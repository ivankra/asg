<!-- Emphatic adverb "ke" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 
可 (kě) can be used to intensify an adjective, or to add emphasis to a verb. It is stronger than other modifiers, as 可 compares the speaker‘s expectations with the actual situation. The meaning of 可 is very reliant on context. 

可 is generally used by Northern speakers and is informal, generally only used in spoken Chinese.

==可 Used to Intensify an Adjective==

===Structure===

<div class="jiegou">

可 + Adj. + 了

</div>

The 了 is almost always there, but it's not 100%.

===Examples===

In these examples, 可 is used a bit like 很, as it is used to intensify an adjective:

<div class="liju">

* 这 只 小 狗 <em>可</em> 淘气 了！<span class="expl">The speaker never expected puppies to be this naughty</span><span class="pinyin">Zhè zhǐ xiǎo gǒu <em>kě</em> táoqì le!</span><span class="trans">This puppy is so naughty!</span> 
* 我 姐姐 <em>可</em> 好 了！有 什么 好吃 的 都 给 我 留着。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ jiějie <em>kě</em> hǎo le! Yǒu shénme hǎochī de dōu gěi wǒ liúzhe.</span><span class="trans">My sister is great! Any good food there is she saves some for me.</span>
* 他 <em>可</em> 优秀 了！你 不 想 见见 吗？<span class="pinyin">Tā <em>kě</em> yōuxiù le! Nǐ bù xiǎng jiànjian ma?</span><span class="trans">He is really excellent! Don't you want to meet him?</span>
* 这 个 游戏 <em>可</em> 好玩 了！推荐 给 你。<span class="pinyin">Zhège yóuxì <em>kě</em> hǎowán le! Tuījiàn gěi nǐ.</span><span class="trans">This game is really fun! I recommend it to you.</span>
* 哇 ，这 个 糖醋 里脊 <em>可</em> 好吃 了！<span class="expl">The speaker never dreamt that sweet and sour pork could taste this good</span><span class="pinyin">Wa, zhège tángcù lǐjí <em>kě</em> hǎochī le!</span><span class="trans">Wow! This sweet and sour pork is delicious!</span> 

</div>

==可 Used to Emphasize a Verb==

===Structure===

<div class="jiegou">

可 + Verb Phrase

</div>

了 is not needed in this pattern, but may be present.

===Examples===

In these examples 可 is used with 别, and sounds a bit like "don't even think about..." in English.

<div class="liju">

* 你 <em>可</em> 别 喝 太 多 酒。 <span class="expl">I know you usually drink a lot, but NOT THIS TIME</span><span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>kě</em> bié hē tài duō jiǔ.</span><span class="trans">Don't drink too much.</span>
* 你 <em>可</em> 别 走！ <span class="expl">I'm blocking your way, almost pleading with you, as I believe you are going to leave</span><span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>kě</em> bié zǒu!</span><span class="trans">Don't go!</span>
* 话 <em>可</em> 不 能 这样 说。 <span class="expl">What you said doesn't accord with my own beliefs</span><span class="pinyin">Huà <em>kě</em> bù néng zhèyàng shuō.</span><span class="trans">You really can't say that.</span>

</div>

==可 as "Finally"==

Sometimes 可 acts like 终于 (zhōngyú), meaning "finally."

===Structure===

<div class="jiegou">

可 + Verb Phrase + 了

</div>

了 will pretty much always be needed when you're talking about something "finally" happening.

===Examples===

<div class="liju">
* 你 <em>可</em> 来 了! <span class="expl">The speaker never expected it would take so long for you to get here</span><span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>kě</em> lái le!</span><span class="trans">You're finally here!</span>
* <em>可</em> 做 完 了 所有 的 工作。<span class="pinyin"><em>Kě</em> zuò wán le suǒyǒu de gōngzuò.</span><span class="trans">I've finally finished all the work.</span> 
</div>
