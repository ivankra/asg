<!-- Expressing "before" and "after" with "zhiqian" and "zhihou" -->
{{Grammar  Box}}

The words "[[before]]" and "[[after]]" can be expressed using 之前 (zhīqián) and 之后 (zhīhòu). They are very similar to [[以前]] (yǐqián) and [[以后]] (yǐhòu), but are slightly more formal.

== Used at the End of a Phrase ==

In this pattern, 之前 and 之后 come at the start of a sentence, right after mention of some kind of event or thing that happened.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Event + 之前 / 之后 ，⋯⋯ 
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

*来 中国 <em>之前</em> ，我 的 汉语 很 一般 。<span class="pinyin">Lái Zhōngguó <em>zhīqián</em>, wǒ de Hànyǔ hěn yībān.</span><span class="trans">Before I came to China, my Chinese was really mediocre.</span>
*下班 <em>之后</em> 给 我  打 个 电话 。<span class="pinyin">Xiàbān <em>zhīhòu</em> gěi wǒ dǎ gè diànhuà.</span><span class="trans">Give me a call after you get off work.</span>

*出国 <em>之前</em> ，他 和 女朋友 分手了 。<span class="pinyin">Chūguó <em>zhīqián</em>, tā hé nǚpéngyou fēnshǒu le.</span><span class="trans">Before he went abroad, he broke up with his girlfriend.</span>

</div>

== Used as a Time Word ==

In this pattern, 之前 and 之后 usually come at the start of a phrase, in the middle of a sentence.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
⋯⋯ ，之前 / 之后 ⋯⋯ 
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

</div>

== Slight Differences between 之前/之后 and 以前/以后 ==

One difference between the two pairs is that 之前/之后 feel more formal simply because they contain [[之]], which is a word common in classical Chinese. Both words are still used in everyday spoken Chinese, however.

In addition, while all four words can mean "before and "after" (referring to time), 之前/之后 also sometimes mean "in front of" or "behind," referring to physical location. (以前/以后 aren't used in this way, but the single characters 前/后 are.) We haven't included examples of the "physical location" usage here, because it's less common and more formal.
