<!-- Expressing "again" in the past with "you" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

Whenever you want to express something that has happened [[again]], as in, "oops, I did it ''again''!" in Chinese, you generally want to use 又 (yòu). (You'll want to use [[Expressing "again" in the future with "zai"|再 (zài) for "again" in the future]].)

== Affirmative Form ==

=== Structure ===

Normally, 又 is used to express an action that has already happened again for (at least) the second time. It doesn't have to be in quick succession; it happened before, and now it's happened again.

<div class="jiegou">
(Subj. +) 又 + Verb + 了
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

*<em>又</em> 下雨 <strong>了</strong> ！<span class="pinyin"><em>Yòu</em> xiàyǔ <strong>le</strong>!</span><span class="trans">It rained again!</span>
*你 <em>又</em> 迟到 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>yòu</em> chídào <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">You're late again.</span>
*宝宝 <em>又</em> 哭 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Bǎobao <em>yòu</em> kū <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">The baby is crying again.</span>
*我 <em>又</em>  忘 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>yòu</em> wàng <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">I forgot again.</span>

</div>

</div>

== Colloquial Saying 又来了 ==

又来了 fits the above pattern, but is also a little tricky because it expresses something that is still ongoing, and has already started as the speaker is speaking. Literally it means "here it comes again," but it's more accurate to translate it as "there it is again," or "there [he] goes again." It indicates that the speaker is a bit annoyed that it happened ''again''.

== Other Usage ==

When it becomes clear that something is about to happen again, you can also use 又. It's almost as if it has already happened in your mind. In these cases, it's quite common for 又 to be immediately followed by 是 (shì), 要 (yào), 可以 (kěyǐ), or 能 (néng), and you'll notice that there's often a [[About to happen with "le"|了, indicating that something is about to happen]].

Some examples:

<div class="liju">

*今天 <em>又</em> <strong>要</strong> 加班 <strong>了</strong> ！<span class="pinyin">Jīntiān <em>yòu</em> <strong>yào</strong> jiābān <strong>le</strong>!</span><span class="trans">We've got to work overtime again today!</span>
*老板 请客 ，<em>又</em> <strong>可以</strong> 吃 大餐 <strong>了</strong> ！<span class="pinyin">Lǎobǎn qǐngkè, <em>yòu</em> <strong>kěyǐ</strong> chī dàcān <strong>le</strong>!</span><span class="trans">The boss is going to treat us. We can have a big meal again!</span>
*快 过年 了 ，我们 <em>又</em> <strong>能</strong> 拿 红包 <strong>了</strong> ！<span class="pinyin">Kuài guònián le, wǒmen <em>yòu</em> <strong>néng</strong> ná hóngbāo <strong>le</strong>!</span><span class="trans">It's almost Chinese New Year. We can get our red packets [of money] again!</span>

</div>
