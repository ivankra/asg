<!-- Measure words with "this" and "that" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

In English, when you refer to "this table" or "that girl" you only need two words: "this" or "that" plus the noun you're referring to.  In Chinese, though, you also need a [[measure word]] in the middle between the two.  In the very beginning you can get away with using [[Measure_word_%22ge%22|个 (gè)]] for everything, but pretty soon you're going to have to start using other measure words in these simple phrases.

== Structure ==

If you use 这 (zhè) or 那 (nà) before a noun, you also need to include a [[measure word]] before the noun.

<div class="jiegou">

这 / 那 + Measure Word + Noun

</div>

== Examples ==

Note: In this usage, the tone of 个 (gè) tends to soften, so it's represented below as a neutral tone.

<div class="liju">

* <em>那</em> <strong>个</strong> 人 <span class="pinyin"> <em>nà</em><strong>ge</strong> rén</span><span class="trans">that person</span>
* <em>这</em> <strong>本</strong> 书 <span class="pinyin"> <em>zhè</em> <strong>běn</strong> shū</span><span class="trans">this book</span>
* <em>那</em> <strong>件</strong> 事 <span class="pinyin"> <em>nà</em> <strong>jiàn</strong> shì</span><span class="trans">that matter (in the sense of business, affair, or thing)</span>
* <em>这</em> <strong>瓶</strong> 啤酒 <span class="pinyin"> <em>zhè</em> <strong>píng</strong> píjiǔ</span><span class="trans">this bottle of beer</span>
* <em>那</em> <strong>个</strong> 房间 <span class="pinyin"> <em>nà</em><strong>ge</strong> fángjiān</span><span class="trans">that room</span>
* <em>那</em> <strong>台</strong> 电脑 <span class="pinyin"> <em>nà</em> <strong>tái</strong> diànnǎo</span><span class="trans">that new computer</span>
* <em>这</em> <strong>只</strong> 猫 <span class="pinyin"> <em>zhè</em> <strong>zhī</strong> māo</span><span class="trans">that cat</span>
* <em>那</em> <strong>条</strong> 河 <span class="pinyin"> <em>nà</em> <strong>tiáo</strong> hé </span><span class="trans">that river</span>
* <em>这</em> <strong>件</strong> 衣服 <span class="pinyin"><em>zhè</em> <strong>jiàn</strong> yīfu </span><span class="trans">this piece of clothing</span>

</div>

Although we didn't get into it here, the same pattern holds true when you use 哪 (nǎ) to ask "which?"
