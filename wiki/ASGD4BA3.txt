<!-- Expressing concern with "kongpa" -->
{{Grammar Box}}
恐怕 (kǒngpà) can be used to express "I'm afraid that," or "I'm concerned that," or even "I'm worried that," followed by some sort of reason. It doesn't need to be something you're ''literally'' afraid of; it may be that you're just trying to soften the blow of some bad news, as in, "I'm afraid that I'm too busy washing my hair tomorrow night to come over and see the 2000 pictures of your trip to ComicCon."

== Structure ==

恐怕 comes at the beginning of the sentence. It's often used with auxiliary verbs such as 要, 会, 能, 得, etc.

<div class="jiegou">
(Reason,) 恐怕 + Subj. ⋯⋯
</div>

Note that it sounds better to put 恐怕 ''before the subject'' of the sentence.
