<!-- Simultaneous tasks with "yibian" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

Multitasking is everywhere in the modern world (what else are you doing while you read this?), but you if can ''focus'' for just a minute, you can learn a way to express simultaneous tasks in Chinese! This can be done with 一边 (yībiān).

== Structure ==

To express that one thing is done ''while'' doing something else, the word 一边 (yībiān) is used. 

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 一边 + Verb (，) + 一边 + Verb
</div>

Note that you sometimes see 一边 (yībiān) shortened to 边 (biān) as well, which has a less formal feel.

== Examples ==

<div class="liju">

*不要 <em>一边</em> 吃 东西，<em>一边</em> 说话 。<span class="pinyin">Bùyào <em>yībiān</em>  chī dōngxi, <em>yībiān</em> shuōhuà.</span><span class="trans">Don't speak while eating.</span>

</div>

You'll notice that the order of the two actions is sometimes different in the original Chinese and the English translations above. This is because the "main" action usually comes second in English (after the "while"), but first in Chinese. For example, "take a shower while singing" sounds strange in English, but "sing while taking a shower" doesn't.

Note that you must be actively doing both actions. That is, they have to be intentional. If you want to say something happened while another thing was happening, it would be better to use [[Expressing "when" with "de shihou"|的时候 (de shíhou)]].
