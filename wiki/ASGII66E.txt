<!-- Using "always" as a complaint with "laoshi" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

We have a few ways to say "[[always]]" in Chinese, and one of them is to use the word 老是 (lǎoshì). 老是 is usually used in the context of a complaint, like how your sister is "always" hogging the bathroom.

== Structure ==

老是 is an adverb, usually translated into English as "always." It expresses that an action or a condition constantly repeats or continues and can be interchanged with [["Always" with "zongshi"|the word 总是]]. However, 老是 also has an unsatisfied or frustrated tone.

<div class="jiegou">
老 (是) + Predicate
</div>

You can also use 老 instead of 老是. The [[predicate]] part of the pattern can be a [[verb]] or an adjective. 

When 老是 is used together with an [[adjective]], 老是 is usually followed by an [[adverb]] such as 不, 很, 非常, 这么, 那 etc.
