结果 (jiéguǒ) can be used as a conjunction or adverb, meaning "as a result" or "consequently." It normally starts the second half of a sentence and can also introduce an unexpected or undesirable result. 

== Indicating a Logical Result ==

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Reason / Condition ，结果 + Result
</div>

=== Examples ===

</div>

== Indicating an Unexpected Result ==

Sometimes there is no cause-effect relationship between what comes before and after 结果 (no logical connection). In these sentences, the second half of the sentence usually emphasizes that what actually happened was unexpected or undesired.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Situation ，结果 + [Unexpected Result]
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

*我 去 机场 接 他 ，<em>结果</em> 没 接到 他 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ qù jīchǎng jiē tā, <em>jiéguǒ</em> méi jiēdào tā.</span><span class="trans">I went to the airport to pick him up. But in the end, I didn't find him there.</span>
