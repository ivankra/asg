<!-- Basic comparisons with "meiyou" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 
In Chinese, there is another way to make comparisons. You can use [[Negation of "you" with "mei"|没有 (méiyǒu)]] to express that something is "not as" ''adjective'' as something else.  (Yes, that's the same 没有 (méiyǒu) that means "not have," used here in a different way.)

== Basic Usage ==

As well as with [[Basic comparisons with "bi"|比 (bǐ)]], you can also use 没有 (méiyǒu) to make basic comparisons. You could think of 没有 (méiyǒu) as the opposite of 比 (bǐ) - it works in the same way, but rather than expressing "more... than..." it expresses "not as... as...":

<div class="jiegou">

Noun 1 + 没有 + Noun 2 + Adj.

</div>

In this structure, the noun that's placed first is ''less'' "adjective" than the second noun, making 没有 (méiyǒu) the ''opposite'' of [[Basic comparisons with "bi"|比 (bǐ)]] for comparison purposes. So in the sentence:

<div class="liju">

* 小张 <em>没有</em> 小李 高 。 <span class="pinyin">Xiǎo Zhāng <em>méiyǒu</em> Xiǎo Lǐ gāo.</span><span class="trans">Xiao Zhang is not as tall as Xiao Li.</span>

</div>

小李 (Xiǎo Lǐ) is taller. The same situation could be described as:

<div class="liju">

* 小李 <em>没有</em> 小张 矮 。 <span class="pinyin">Xiǎo Lǐ <em>méiyǒu</em> Xiǎo Zhāng ǎi.</span><span class="trans">Xiao Li is not as short as Xiao Zhang.</span>

</div>
