<!-- Structure of days of the week -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

星期 (xīngqī) means "week" in Chinese. This is also used to indicate which weekday you are talking about.

== Structure ==

Days of the week in Chinese are formed by the word "week" followed by a number:

<table class="table big-text table-striped table-bordered">
<tr>
<th style="width:25%">English</th>
<th style="width:25%">Chinese</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Monday</td>
<td>星期一<span class="pinyin">Xīngqīyī</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tuesday</td>
<td>星期二<span class="pinyin">Xīngqī'èr</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Wednesday</td>
<td>星期三<span class="pinyin">Xīngqīsān</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Thursday</td>
<td>星期四<span class="pinyin">Xīngqīsì</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Friday</td>
<td>星期五<span class="pinyin">Xīngqīwǔ</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Saturday</td>
<td>星期六<span class="pinyin">Xīngqīliù</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sunday</td>
<td>星期天<span class="pinyin">Xīngqītiān</span></td>
</tr>
</table>

Notice that Sunday is the only exception. Rather than a number, 天 (tiān) is used. More formally, Sunday is also referred to as 星期日 (Xīngqīrì).

One other implication of this system that you may not have noticed: "day one" is Monday. In Chinese culture, the first day of the week is Monday, and ''not'' Sunday.

== Other Words for "Week" ==

Hopefully this doesn't freak you out, but there are actually two other ways to say "week" in Chinese. You should still learn 星期 (xīngqī) first, and that's really all you need as a beginner. 

The other words for "week" are 礼拜 (lǐbài) and 周 (zhōu). Skip them for now unless you really need them.
