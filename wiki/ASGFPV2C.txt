<!-- Expressing "no wonder" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 
怪不得 (guàibude) can be used to express that the speaker finds something unsurprising. It can be used alone or in a variety of different structures, as shown below. 难怪 (nánguài) is another way to express the exact same thing.

== Emphasis on 怪不得 / 难怪 ==

怪不得 is used to convey the speaker's newfound understanding of a situation, having recently acquired some new information that, in his opinion, explains it. 

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Reason ，怪不得 / 难怪 + [Observation]
</div>

怪不得 can be replaced with 难怪 in the structure without altering its meaning.

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

*小张 请假 了，<em>怪不得</em> 今天 没有 看到 他 。<span class="pinyin">Xiǎo Zhāng qǐngjià le, <em>guàibude</em> jīntiān méiyǒu kàndào tā.</span><span class="trans">Little Zhang asked for vacation time, no wonder I haven't seen him today.</span>

</div>

== The Other Meaning of 难怪 ==

This usage is definitely less common, but sometimes 难怪 is a combination of the [[Difficult to do something|难 + Verb]] pattern and the verb 怪, meaning "to blame." In this case, the meaning is totally different.  Although it's not as common, and you shouldn't need to worry about it too much, we include it here because if you ever run into and think that 难怪 can only ever have one meaning, it can totally throw you for a loop.

A few examples:

<div class="liju">

*这 也 <em>难怪</em> 他 ，他 这么 小 。<span class="pinyin"> Zhè yě <em>nánguài</em> tā, tā zhème xiǎo.</span><span class="trans">We can't really blame him. He's so young.</span>
*这 也 <em>难怪</em> 大家 ，是 我们 通知 晚 了 。<span class="pinyin">Zhè yě <em>nánguài</em> dàjiā, shì wǒmen tōngzhī wǎn le.</span><span class="trans">We can't really blame everybody. It was such short notice.</span>

</div>

When used in this way it expresses that the speaker assigns no blame in the situation he is describing. Sometimes the specific person undeserving of blame is mentioned directly after 难怪, but not always.
