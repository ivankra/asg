<!-- Expressing ongoing duration with double "le" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

The 了 (le) particle is used in many different ways. In this article, we will explore how to use the double 了 (le) to express the duration of an activity that is ongoing.

== Ongoing Duration with Simple Verbs ==

Expressing [[Expressing duration with "le"|''how long'' you did something in the past]] is one thing, but what if the action is still ongoing?

A clarifying example (in English) is appropriate:

* I lived in Shanghai for 5 years. (concluded, not ongoing)
* I have lived in Shanghai for 5 years. (mostly likely ongoing)
* I have been living in Shanghai for 5 years. (definitely ongoing)

This article is about expressing the third situation above, the one which is ''definitely ongoing''.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + Verb + 了 + Duration + 了

</div>

The first 了 (le) is placed after the verb (to indicate that the action is completed), followed by the duration, followed by an additional 了 (le) which tells us that the action has not concluded and is ongoing.  You can think of the second 了 (le) as communicating the meaning of "up until now."

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

* 你 睡 <em>了</em> <strong>一 天</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ shuì <em>le</em> <strong>yī tiān</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">You have been sleeping for the whole day.</span>
* 他 在 北京 住 <em>了</em> <strong>两 年</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin">Tā zài Běijīng zhù <em>le</em> <strong>liǎng nián</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">He has been living in Beijing for two years.</span>
* 这 个 会，他们 开 <em>了</em> <strong>两 个 小时</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin">Zhège huì, tāmen kāi <em>le</em> <strong>liǎng gè xiǎoshí</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">They've been holding this meeting for the past two hours.</span>
* 我 在 这儿 等 <em>了</em> <strong>半 个 小时</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ zài zhèr děng <em>le</em> <strong>bàn gè xiǎoshí</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">I have been waiting here for half an hour.</span>
* 他们 在 酒吧 待 <em>了</em> <strong>一 个 晚上</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin">Tāmen zài jiǔbā dāi <em>le</em> <strong>yī gè wǎnshang</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">They have been staying at the bar for the whole evening.</span>

</div>

== When the Verb Takes an Object ==

=== Structure ===

Note that in the examples above, the verbs have no objects.  When the verb has an object, the verb is often repeated:

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + Verb + Obj. + Verb + 了 + Duration + 了
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

* 我 学 中文 学 <em>了</em> <strong>一 年</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ xué Zhōngwén xué <em>le</em> <strong>yī nián</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">I have been learning Chinese for a year.</span>
* 他 打 电话 打 <em>了</em> <strong>一 个 多 小时</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin">Tā dǎ diànhuà dǎ <em>le</em> <strong>yī gè duō xiǎoshí</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">He has been on the phone for more than an hour.</span>
* 老板 打 游戏 打 <em>了</em> <strong>一 个 上午</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin">Lǎobǎn dǎ yóuxì dǎ <em>le</em> <strong>yī gè shàngwǔ</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">The boss has been playing video games all morning.</span>
* 你 洗澡 洗 <em>了</em> <strong>差不多 一 个 小时</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ xǐzǎo xǐ <em>le</em> <strong>chàbuduō yī gè xiǎoshí</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">You have been showering for almost an hour.</span>
* 妈妈 看电视 看 <em>了</em> <strong>一 晚上</strong> <em>了</em>。<span class="pinyin"> Māma kàn diànshì kàn <em>le</em> <strong>yī wǎnshang</strong> <em>le</em>.</span><span class="trans">Mom has been watching TV all evening.</span>
