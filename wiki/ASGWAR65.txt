<!-- Expressing "had better" with "haishi" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

One of the ways to use 还是 (háishì) is to have it mean "you had better," after having compared two options. Usually there's even a bit of deliberation before the speaker announces what "it would be better" to do, using 还是.

== Structure ==

还是 as an [[adverbs|adverb]] can express "had better" or "it would be better to."  The idea is that the speaker has given the matter some thought, and after considering it, has finally come to a decision.  The announcement of this decision will frequently include 还是, and it usually comes before a verb or a subject.

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 还是 + [Verb Phrase] + 吧
</div>

吧 is often placed after this structure, [[Softening speech with "ba"|as it's a suggestion]].

== Examples ==

<div class="liju">

*<em>还是</em> 明天 去 吧 。<span class="pinyin"><em>Háishì</em> míngtiān qù ba.</span><span class="trans">We'd better go tomorrow.</span>
*<em>还是</em> 让 她 进来 吧 。<span class="pinyin"><em>Háishì</em> ràng tā jìnlái ba.</span><span class="trans">We'd better let her come in.</span>
*你 <em>还是</em> 快点 走 吧 。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>háishì</em> kuài diǎn zǒu ba.</span><span class="trans">You'd better leave now.</span>
*我们 <em>还是</em> 帮帮 他 吧 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒmen <em> háishì</em> bāngbang tā ba.</span><span class="trans">We'd better help him.</span>
*太 晚 了 ，<em>还是</em> 先 回家 吧 。<span class="pinyin">Tài wǎn le, <em>háishì</em> xiān huíjiā ba.</span><span class="trans">It's too late. We'd better go home now.</span>
*这里 太 脏 了，我们 <em>还是</em> 走 吧 。<span class="pinyin">Zhèlǐ tài zāng le, wǒmen <em>háishì</em> zǒu ba.</span><span class="trans">It's too dirty here; we'd better leave.</span>
*快 迟到 了 ，我们 <em>还是</em> 打车 吧 。<span class="pinyin">Kuài chídào le, wǒmen <em>háishì</em> dǎchē ba.</span><span class="trans">We're running late. Let's take a taxi.</span>

</div>

When the part after 还是 is a negative verb phrase, it's OK to drop the 吧 at the end.

<div class="liju">

*太 贵 了 ，<em>还是</em> 别 买 了 。<span class="pinyin">Tài guì le, <em>háishì</em> bié mǎi le.</span><span class="trans">It's too expensive. You'd better not buy it.</span>
*她 不 想 说 ，<em>还是</em> 不要 再 问 了 。<span class="pinyin">Tā bù xiǎng shuō, <em>háishì</em> bùyào zài wèn le.</span><span class="trans">She doesn't want to say. We'd better not ask again.</span>
*他 一定 不 同意 ，<em>还是</em> 别 跟 他 说 了 。<span class="pinyin">Tā yīdìng bù tóngyì, <em>háishì</em> bié gēn tā shuō le.</span><span class="trans">He will definitely not agree to it. We'd better not say anything to him.</span>

</div>
