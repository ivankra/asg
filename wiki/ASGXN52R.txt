<!-- Expressing "and" with "he" (advanced) -->
{{Grammar Box}} 
You probably learned early on that 和 (hé) is used as an "[[and]]" word to connect [[noun]]s and noun phrases,  but ''not'' sentences or clauses. This rule is fine for a while but eventually you will begin encountering what appears to be non-nouns linked by 和. This article addresses how you may see 和 used in other ways.

It's worth mentioning that none of these uses of 和 ''needs'' to be ''used''. You could do just fine only using 和 to connect nouns and noun phrases, and native speakers may prefer ''not'' to use 和 in some of the examples sentences given below. Still, uses like these ''do'' exist.

== Linking Verbs with 和 ==

Rather than give absolute rules, it's more helpful to give trends, because it's very difficult to provide a rule for using 和 with non-nouns which is never broken. There are just too many gray areas.

In ''most cases'', the following trends apply when 和 is used to connect verbs:

# The two verbs are very similar in nature. This could include characteristics such as level of formality, structure, and scope. Often you'll find that the verbs even overlap a little in meaning or are frequently used together. Thus 唱歌和跳舞 is natural (both are [[separable verb]]s, equally informal, frequently used together), whereas 玩游戏和跑 (the structure of the two is very different) is quite awkward.
# Both verbs share the same object (e.g. 管理和运营一家公司) or are both modified by the same adverbial phrase (e.g. 进一步地了解和交流).
# Normally (but not always) both verbs are two-syllable verbs, such as 维护, 修理.

</div>

== Linking Adjectives with 和 ==

In ''most cases'', at least one of the following trends apply when 和 is used to connect adjectives:

# The two adjectives often act as an [[attributive]] (coming before a noun), [[object]] (coming after a verb), or other sentence element.
# If the two adjectives act as the [[predicate]] of the sentence, there will be some kind of modifier before the adjectives; they won't just be used "bare"

</div>

== Incorrect uses of 和 ==

Don't forget that in addition to 和, there are all kinds of other ways to express the "[[and]]" meaning, such as the words [[并]], [[并且]], and [[还有]], or the patterns [["Both A and B" with "you"|又⋯⋯又⋯⋯]] or [["Both… and…" with "ji...you"|既⋯⋯又⋯⋯]]. Below are some sentences that don't follow the trends laid out above, and are thus not good sentences. 

In this first group, the "bare" (unmodified) adjectives don't sound good when using 和:

<div class="liju">
<ul>
<li class="x">你 <strong>自私</strong> <em>和</em> <strong>冷漠</strong>，怎么 会 有 人 喜欢 你 ？！<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <strong>zìsī</strong> <em>hé</em> <strong>lěngmò</strong>, zěnme huì yǒu rén xǐhuan nǐ?!</span></li>
<li class="o">你 <strong>这么 自私</strong> <em>和</em> <strong>冷漠</strong> ， 怎么 会 有 人 喜欢 你 ？！<span class="pinyin">Nǐ zhème zìsī hé lěngmò, zěnme huì yǒu rén xǐhuan nǐ?!</span><span class="trans">You're so selfish and cold, how could anyone like you?</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

In this second group, using 和 to group two totally different verbs with different objects sounds bad. It's actually better to just drop the 和 completely!

<div class="liju">
<ul>
<li class="x">我 <strong>去 了 超市</strong> <em>和</em> <strong>买 了 水果</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <strong>qù le chāoshì</strong>, <em>hé</em> <strong>mǎi le shuǐguǒ</strong>.</span></li>
<li class="o">我 去 了 超市 ， 买 了 水果 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ qù le chāoshì, mǎi le shuǐguǒ.</span><span class="trans">I went to the supermarket and bought fruit.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

Finally, in this last group the verbs share an object, and they're both monosyllabic verbs. While perhaps not blatantly incorrect, this sentence just sounds weird to most Chinese. Using 和 with two-syllable verbs rather than one-syllable verbs sounds more natural:

<div class="liju">
<ul>
<li class="q">你 需要 <strong>买</strong> <em>和</em> <strong>装</strong> 杀毒 软件 。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ xūyào <strong>mǎi</strong> <em>hé</em> <strong>zhuāng</strong> shādú ruǎnjiàn.</span></li>
<li class="o">你 需要 <strong>购买</strong> <em>和</em> <strong>安装</strong> 杀毒 软件 。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ xūyào <strong>gòumǎi</strong> <em>hé</em> <strong>ānzhuāng</strong> shādú ruǎnjiàn.</span><span class="trans">You need to purchase and install anti-virus software.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
