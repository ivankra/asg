<!-- Comparing "cai" and "jiu" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

Both 才 (cái) and 就 (jiù) are adverbs that have to do with expressing time, and they are both placed before verbs. However, they typically have opposite effects on the tone of the sentence, with 才 (cái) implying a sense of lateness, and 就 (jiù) imparting a sense of earliness.

== Emphasis with 才 ==

=== Expressing Lateness with 才 ===

[[Expressing lateness with "cai"|才 indicates]] that the speaker feels that the events discussed happened later than expected. Sometimes it also expresses anxiety, impatience, anger, or other related emotions.

=== Expressing Small Quantity with 才 ===

才 can also mean "only" in the sense of a small quantity.

==== Structure ====

<div class="jiegou">
才 ( + Verb) + Measure Word + Noun 
</div>

The key thing to pay attention to here is that the 才 goes ''before'' the ''verb'', and not the "small quantity" that follows it.

==== Examples ====

<div class="liju">

* 我们 有 这么 多 人，你 <em>才</em> 点 了 三 个 菜。  <span class="pinyin">Wǒmen yǒu zhème duō rén, nǐ <em>cái</em> diǎn le sān gè cài.</span><span class="trans">We have so many people and you only ordered three dishes.</span>
* 我 买 了 这么 多 东西，<em>才</em> 花 了 五 百 块 。 <span class="pinyin">Wǒ mǎi le zhème duō dōngxi, <em>cái</em> huā le wǔ bǎi kuài.</span><span class="trans">I bought this many things, and I only spent 500 RMB.</span>

</div>

=== Expressing "Not Late" with 才 and Time ===

When 才 is followed by a time, it can express the idea of "only," as in, "it's only 9 o'clock," expressing the idea that "9 o'clock is not late." This would seem to be the opposite of the 才 expressing "lateness," but it's important to remember that this 才 precedes a ''time'', and not an ''action''.

==== Structure ====

<div class="jiegou">
(现在) + 才 + Time 
</div>

==== Examples ====

<div class="liju">

*现在 <em>才</em> 九点 ，再 玩 一会儿 。<span class="pinyin">Xiànzài <em>cái</em> jiǔ diǎn, zài wán yīhuìr.</span><span class="trans">It's only nine o'clock. Stay and hang out a little bit more.</span>
*<em>才</em> 六点 ，起 那么 早 干吗 ？<span class="pinyin"><em>Cái</em> liù diǎn, qǐ nàme zǎo gànmá?</span><span class="trans">It's only six. Why did you get up so early?</span>

</div>

== Emphasis with 就 ==

=== Expressing Earliness with 就 === 

[[Expressing earliness with "jiu"|就 indicates]] that something has occurred earlier than the speaker expected. There may be an accompanying feeling of surprise or amazement.

=== Expressing Small Quantity with 就 === 

就 can be used to mean "only," in the sense of a small quantity.

If you're thinking, "''didn't we just learn to use 才 to also mean small quantity??''" then you're very perceptive, and the answer is ''yes''. For this "small quantity" emphasis, both 才 and 就 can be used before the verb to express essentially the same thing. (If you really want to split hairs, native speakers might say that there's a tiny difference in emphasis between the two, but that level of nuance goes beyond the scope of this grammar point.)

== Using 才 and 就 Together ==

They're not matter and anti-matter; these two "opposite" words can actually be used together. When used together, they're the "just recently" meaning of 才 and the "early" meaning of 就. Together, they indicate that one thing ''just happened recently'', and then the other happened ''soon after''.
