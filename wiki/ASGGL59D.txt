<!-- Expressing "when" with "shi" -->
{{Grammar Box}}

By now you should now [["When" with "de shihou"|how to express "when" using 的时候 (de shíhou)]]. But there's also a slightly shorter, more formal way to do it: simply use 时 (shí) all by itself. (No 的!)

== Structure ==

<div class="jiegou">
Time + 时 ，Subj. ⋯⋯
</div>

As [[time word]]s can appear [[Time words and word order|before or after the subject]], you can also place the "Time + 时" phrase after the subject.

== Examples ==

<div class="liju">

*考试 <em>时</em> 不要 说话 。<span class="pinyin">Kǎoshì <em>shí</em> bùyào shuōhuà.</span><span class="trans">Don't talk when you're taking a test.</span>

There are also two great examples of this pattern in the poem 《远和近》 by Gu Cheng (顾城) below:

<blockquote>
你

一会看我

一会看云

我觉得

你看我时很远

你看云时很近
</blockquote>
