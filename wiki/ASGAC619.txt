<!-- Alternative existential sentences -->

Expressing something's existence in a certain place or location is not just limited to 在 (zài) and 有 (yǒu). The word order may be a little different from what you are used to, but 着 (zhe) and 是 (shì) are also ways to make everyday statements such as, "There is a book lying on the desk."

== Pattern with 着 ==

Verbs that are paired with 着 are usually [[stative verb]]s. So unlike with [[action verb]]s, you're going to be describing an action that is kind of like just sitting there. It could be standing there, lying there, sitting there hanging there... the point is it isn't actively expending energy ''doing'' anything. 

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Place + Verb + 着 + [Noun Phrase]
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class= "liju">

*桌子 上 放 <em>着</em> 一 本 书 。<span class="pinyin">Zhuōzi shàng fàng <em>zhe</em> yī běn shū .</span><span class="trans">There is a book on the desk.</span>
*大厅 里 站 <em>着</em> 一些 警察 。<span class="pinyin">Dàtīng lǐ zhàn <em>zhe</em> yīxiē jǐngchá.</span><span class="trans">There are several policemen standing in the hall.</span>
*教室 里 坐 <em>着</em> 两 百 多 个 学生 。<span class="pinyin">Jiàoshì lǐ zuò <em>zhe</em> liǎng bǎi duō gè xuéshēng.</span><span class="trans">There are more than two hundred students sitting in the classroom.</span>
*地下室 里 堆 <em>着</em> 很 多 旧 东西 。<span class="pinyin">Dìxiàshì lǐ duī <em>zhe</em> hěn duō jiù dōngxi.</span><span class="trans">There is lots of old stuff piled up in the basement.</span>
*楼下 停 <em>着</em> 几 辆 车 。<span class="pinyin">Lóuxià tíng <em>zhe</em> jǐ liàng chē.</span><span class="trans">A few cars are parked downstairs.</span>

</div>

Note that in English we sometimes use a verb in its "-ing" form, and sometimes use the passive "-ed" form of the verb.

== Pattern with 是 ==

The subject in the 是 sentence pattern indicates the location or area. The object that comes after 是 is the only thing (worth mentioning) in that area. It's worth noting that there's no real time indication for most sentences like this. It could be setting a scene in a story (in the past), or it could be describing the current state of things (in the present).

</div>

Note that 是 is used to describe a singular object existing somewhere, while 有 can refer to multiple objects/people.
