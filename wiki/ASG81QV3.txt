<!-- Expressing difficulty with "hao (bu) rongyi" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 
好不容易 (hǎo bù róngyì) means "very difficult" or "really not easy." It is often used where the speaker wants to comment on the result of their hard work, something like "It was really hard for me to x, but then I realized y."

==Adverbial Structure with 才==

Sentences using 好不容易 are often followed by [[Expressing lateness with "cai"|才 (cái)]], emphasizing the action has been completed only with great difficulty.

===Structure===

Strange as it might seem, 好容易 has ''the same meaning'' as 好不容易, and can be used interchangeably. 好不容易 is more common.

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + 好 (不) 容易 + 才 + [Result]

</div>

The "result" part can be a simple phrase or a whole clause.

===Examples===

<div class="liju">

</div>

== Adjectival Structure (without 才) ==

===Structure===

<div class="jiegou">

Verb / [Verb Phrase] + 好容易 / 好不容易 

</div>

In this simpler structure we use 好(不)容易 by itself to express “with great difficulty”. At the end of the sentence particles such as 啊 or 哦 will also often be used to add emotion.

===Examples===

<div class="liju">

* 要 完成 这 个 大 项目 <em>好不容易</em> 啊。<span class="pinyin">Yào wánchéng zhège dà xiàngmù <em>hǎobù róngyì</em> a.</span><span class="trans">Finishing this big project will not be an easy task.</span>
