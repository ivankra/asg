<!-- Comparing "renjia" and "bieren" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

When referring to other people, we can use both the words 人家  (rénjia) and 别人 (biérén). But 人家 has additional grammatical uses which we will explore in this article.  

== Both can mean "others" ==

人家 and 别人 both refer to others besides the speaker and the listener. However, 人家 is more colloquial. 

人家 and 别人 are interchangeable in these sentences below.

<div class="liju">

*我 不 在乎 <em>人家</em> 怎么 说 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ bù zàihu <em>rénjia</em> zěnme shuō.</span><span class="trans">I don't care about what other people say.</span>
*<em>别人</em> 怎么 想 我 怎么 知道 ？<span class="pinyin"><em>Biérén</em> zěnme xiǎng wǒ zěnme zhīdào?</span><span class="trans">How could I know what other people are thinking?</span>
*那 是 <em>人家</em> 的 事 ，你 管 那么 多 干嘛 ？<span class="pinyin">Nà shì <em>rénjia</em> de shì, nǐ guǎn nàme duō gàn ma?</span><span class="trans">That's other people's business. Why get involved?</span>

</div>

== Additional Uses of 人家 ==

For these additional uses of 人家, it would be incorrect to use 别人.

=== 人家 as "I" or "me" ===

人家 can be used to refer to yourself, and it is often used this way by women, giving it a sort of girly, shy, tender feeling.

<div class="liju">
*因为 <em>人家</em> 喜欢 你 啊 。<span class="pinyin">Yīnwèi <em>rénjia</em> xǐhuan nǐ a.</span><span class="trans">Because I like you!</span>
*讨厌 ！老是 拿 <em>人家</em> 开玩笑 。<span class="pinyin">Tǎoyàn! Lǎo shì ná <em>rénjia</em> kāiwánxiào.</span><span class="trans">You are so annoying! You're always making fun of me.</span>
</div>

=== 人家 as "him" or "her" ===

人家 can also refer to someone previously referred to (in the context of the conversation or body of text) or it can refer to a certain someone that both the speaker and listener know.

<div class="liju">
*你 快 给 <em>人家</em> 道歉 。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ kuài gěi <em>rénjia</em> dàoqiàn.</span><span class="trans">Apologize to them now.</span>
*你 看 <em>人家</em> 多 聪明 ！<span class="pinyin">Nǐ kàn <em>rénjia</em> duō cōngming!</span><span class="trans">Look how smart he is!</span>
</div>

=== 人家 as "residents" ===

人家 can also refer to households. In this case, it's pronounced as "rénjiā" rather than "rénjia." This use is going to be the least common in everyday spoken Chinese. 

<div class="liju">
*这个 小区 有 多少 <strong>户</strong> <em>人家</em> ？<span class="pinyin">Zhège xiǎoqū yǒu duōshao <strong>hù</strong> <em>rénjiā</em>?</span><span class="trans">How many households are here in this neighborhood?</span>
*村子 里 现在 只 剩 十 <strong>户</strong> <em>人家</em> 了 。<span class="pinyin">Cūnzi lǐ xiànzài zhī shèng shí <strong>hù</strong> <em>rénjiā</em> le.</span><span class="trans">There are only ten households left in this village.</span>
</div>
