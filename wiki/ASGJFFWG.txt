<!-- Comparing "gang" and "gangcai" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

刚 (gāng) and 刚才 (gāngcái) have similar meanings of "[[just]] (now)," but they differ on a few key uses.

== 刚 as "Just Happened" ==

刚 is actually an [[adverb]], and it is placed in front of the verb. It emphasizes that the action ''just'' happened a short time ago. Unsurprisingly, it is similar to the English "just." 刚刚 and 刚 are interchangeable in this case. 

The key here is that "a short time ago" is relative and determined by the speaker. For this reason, 刚 can indicate that something "just" happened 1 second ago, 5 minutes ago, 2 hours ago, 3 weeks ago, or even a year ago. The absolute time is flexible, but from the speaker's perspective, it ''feels'' recent.

=== 刚 Before a Verb ===

One thing that confuses a lot of learners is that when you use 刚 with a verb, ''you normally don't need 了''. Keep that in mind while reading the following examples, and look for the explanation below.

A few examples:

<div class="liju">

<ul>
<li class="o">他 <em>刚</em> 到 。<span class="expl">This gives the impression that not only did he just get here, but he should still be here.</span><span class="pinyin">Tā <em>gāng</em> dào.</span><span class="trans">He just arrived.</span>
<li class="o">我们 昨天 <em>刚</em> 到 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒmen zuótiān <em>gāng</em> dào.</span><span class="trans">We just arrived yesterday.</span>
<li class="o">真 不巧 ，老板 <em>刚</em> 走 。<span class="pinyin">Zhēn bùqiǎo, lǎobǎn <em>gāng</em> zǒu.</span><span class="trans">What bad timing. The boss just left.</span>
</ul>

</div>

It would be wrong to use 刚才 instead:

<div class="liju">

<ul>
<li class="x">他 <em>刚才</em> 到 。<span class="pinyin">Tā <em>gāngcái</em> dào.</span></li>
<li class="x">我们 昨天 <em>刚才</em> 到 。<span class="expl">刚才 should be used for events a lot closer in time than 昨天.</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒmen zuótiān <em>gāngcái</em> dào.</span></li>
<li class="x">真 不巧 ，老板 <em>刚才</em> 走 。<span class="pinyin">Zhēn bùqiǎo, lǎobǎn <em>gāngcái</em> zǒu.</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

And if you mean to say "when I first arrived in Shanghai," use 刚 instead of 刚才:

<div class="liju">
*我 <em>刚</em> 到 上海 的 时候 ，谁 都 不 认识 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāng</em> dào Shànghǎi de shíhou, shéi dōu bù rènshi.</span><span class="trans">I didn't know anyone when I had just arrived in Shanghai.</span>
</div>

=== 刚 or 刚刚 Before an Adjective ===

刚, as an adverb, can also be placed in front of an adjective, while 刚才 can't be used this way. 刚 can also be used interchangeably with 刚刚.

A few examples:

<div class="liju">

*他 的 感冒 <em>刚刚</em> 好 。<span class="pinyin">Tā de gǎnmào <em>gānggāng</em> hǎo.</span><span class="trans">He just recovered from his cold.</span>
*天 <em>刚</em> 晴 。<span class="pinyin">Tiān <em>gāng</em> qíng.</span><span class="trans">The sky just became clear.</span>
*牛肉 <em>刚</em> 熟 。 <span class="pinyin">Niúròu <em>gāng</em> shú.</span><span class="trans">The beef just got cooked.</span>

</div>

== 刚才 as "Just Now" ==

刚才 is a [[time noun]] (like 今天 and 现在), and it expresses that the time elapsed is really short, in near-absolute terms.  We're talking no more than 1-30 minutes in most situations, and often less than 5 minutes. When used before a verb, 刚才 emphasizes something happened "''just now''."

A few examples:

<div class="liju">

*他 <em>刚才</em> 哭 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="expl">He was crying a moment ago but he stopped.</span><span class="pinyin">Tā <em>gāngcái</em> kū <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">He was crying just now.</span>
*我 <em>刚才</em> 看到 他 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="expl">Sounds like he's not here anymore; I just saw him, but don't see him now.</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāngcái</em> kàndào tā <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">I just now saw him.</span>
*现在 我 感觉 比 <em>刚才</em> 好 一点 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Xiànzài wǒ gǎnjué bǐ <em>gāngcái</em> hǎo yīdiǎn <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">I feel a little better now than just before.</span>

</div>

刚才, as a time noun, can directly modify a noun to indicate it is that one from "just now" or "just before," while 刚 can't be used this way. 

<div class="liju">

<ul>
<li class="x"><em>刚</em> <strong>的 事情</strong> 太 让 人 生气 了 。<span class="pinyin"><em>Gāng</em> <strong>de shìqing</strong> tài ràng rén shēngqì le.</span><span class="trans">What just happened is really upsetting.</span></li>
<li class="o"><em>刚才</em> <strong>的 事情</strong> 太 让 人 生气 了 。<span class="pinyin"><em>Gāngcái</em> <strong>de shìqing</strong> tài ràng rén shēngqì le.</span><span class="trans">What just happened is really upsetting.</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

== 刚 and 刚才 with 了 ==

You may have noticed that something interesting is going on with regards to [[了]] in the sentences with 刚 and 刚才. Namely, 了 is not usually required in sentences with 刚, but it is usually required in sentences with 刚才. This is because 刚才 refers to a time in the ''recent past'', and you're usually indicated that something ''happened just now'' (started and finished).

Take these sentences for example:

<div class="liju">
*我 昨天 看 了 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ zuótiān kàn le.</span><span class="trans">I looked at it yesterday.</span>
*我 <em>刚才</em> 看 了 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ gāngcái kàn le.</span><span class="trans">I looked at it just now.</span>
</div>

So these are both simple "subject + verb" sentences. Notice that when they refer to the ''past'' (including the one with 刚才), the action is completed and you need 了. You don't need 了 for things that haven't happened yet (they're just plans, and nothing is completed). And remember that 刚才 ''always refers to the past.''

OK, now what about 刚? ''Why does it not need 了?'' The key is that you don't need a 了 in a sentence with 刚 if the verb ''already indicates a clear result''. So, to use the 看 example from above:

<div class="liju">

<ul>
<li class="o">我 <em>刚</em> <strong>看到</strong> 。<span class="expl">Adding a 到 to 看 gives the verb a meaning of the result of "looking at."</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāng</em> <strong>kàndào</strong>.</span><span class="trans">I just saw it.</span></li>
<li class="x">我 <em>刚</em> 看到 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="expl">了 is not needed here as 看到 includes the result of "looking at."</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāng</em> kàndào <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">I just saw it.</span></li>
<li class="o">我 <em>刚才</em> 看到 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="expl">了 is needed with 刚才 because it feels so recent and unresolved.</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāngcái</em> kàndào <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">I saw it just now.</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

A few more examples:

<div class="liju">

<ul>
<li class="o">我 <em>刚</em> <strong>到</strong> 。<span class="expl">The verb 到 includes a clear result.</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāng</em> <strong>dào</strong>.</span><span class="trans">I just arrived.</span></li>
<li class="o">你 <em>刚</em> <strong>知道</strong> 吗 ？<span class="expl">The verb 知道 always includes the result of "knowing."</span><span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>gāng</em>
 <strong>zhīdào</strong> ma?</span><span class="trans">You just found out?</span></li>
<li class="o">宝宝 <em>刚</em> <strong>醒</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Bǎobao <em>gāng</em> <strong>xǐng</strong>.</span><span class="expl">The verb 醒 includes a clear enough indication of result.</span><span class="trans">The baby just woke up.</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

== 刚 and 刚才 with 没 ==

There's also something going on with [[没]] in sentences with 刚 and 刚才. The deal here is that you can say something ''didn't happen '''just now''''' (刚才), but you can't say that something '''''just''' didn't happen'' (刚). [Saying that something "just didn't happen" only works in English if you interpret "just" to mean "simply."]

The takeaway? Just don't use 刚 in sentences where you use 没 to negate the past.

<div class="liju">

<ul>
<li class="x">我 <em>刚</em> <strong>没</strong> 看到 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāng</em> <strong>méi</strong> kàndào.</span><span class="expl">Don't use 刚 with 没 in the past.</span><span class="trans">I just didn't see it.</span></li>
<li class="x">我 <em>刚</em> <strong>没</strong> 听懂 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāng</em> <strong>méi</strong> tīngdǒng.</span><span class="trans">I didn't understand just now.</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

Use 没 with 刚才 (and no 了) to negate the past.

<div class="liju">

<ul>
<li class="o">我 <em>刚才</em> <strong>没</strong> 看到 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāngcái</em> <strong>méi</strong> kàndào.</span><span class="trans">I didn't see it just now.</span></li>
<li class="o">我 <em>刚才</em> <strong>没</strong> 听懂 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>gāngcái</em> <strong>méi</strong> tīngdǒng.</span><span class="trans">I didn't understand just now.</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

== Example Dialog ==

<div class="liju">

<ul class="dialog">
<li><span class="speaker">A:</span> 你 <em>刚才</em> 去 哪儿 了 ？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>gāngcái</em> qù nǎr le?</span><span class="trans">Where did you go just now?</span></li>
<li><span class="speaker">B:</span> 我 去 上 厕所 了 。<em>刚</em> 回来 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ qù shàng cèsuǒ le. <em>Gāng</em> huílái.</span><span class="trans">I went to the bathroom. I just got back.</span></li>
</ul>

</div>
