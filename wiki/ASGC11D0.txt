<!-- Expressing "as expected" with "guoran" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

You can add the adverb 果然 (guǒrán) to add the sense that what you're about to say is entirely expected. It's kind of like starting a sentence with "just as we thought" or "just as we expected," but it's just one word in Chinese. It's kind of like the opposite of [[竟然]] or [[居然]].
