<!-- Expressing duration of inaction -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

Saying how long you have ''not'' done something is not difficult, but the word order is different from the [[Expressing duration with "le"|regular pattern for expressing duration]]. If there's a consistent keyword in this pattern, it's going to be [[没]] (méi), since it almost always plays a role.

== Structure ==

Remember, this pattern differs from both [[Expressing duration with "le"|simple pattern for expressing duration]] and the [[Expressing ongoing duration with double "le"|pattern for ongoing duration]]. 

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + (已经 +) Duration + 没 + Verb + 了
</div>

So now the duration comes right after the subject and 了 is at the end of the sentence. The verb has to be [[Negation of past actions|negated with 没]], as the action ''hasn't'' happened.

Note that 已经 can be omitted.

== Examples ==

<div class="liju">

*他们 <strong>已经</strong> 两 天 <em>没</em> 吃 东西 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Tāmen <strong>yǐjīng</strong> liǎng tiān <em>méi</em> chī dōngxi <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">They haven't eating anything for two days already.</span>

</div>

In English, we may say something like, "I haven't eaten since 9:00 this morning" or "I haven't been to China since the year 2000." Note that the Chinese do not tend to say somebody hasn't done something since a ''certain point in time''. Instead, you should either express it as a duration of time that one hasn't done something (as in the above examples), or you can say "the last time somebody did something was [a certain point in time]."

<div class="liju">
*我 已经 十 年 <em>没</em> 来 中国 <strong>了</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ yǐjīng shí nián <em>méi</em> lái Zhōngguó <strong>le</strong>.</span><span class="trans">It's been 10 years since I came to China last.</span>
*我 <em>上次</em> 来 中国 <em>是</em> 2010 年 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>shàngcì</em> lái Zhōngguó <em>shì</em> èr-líng-yī-líng nián.</span><span class="trans">The last time I came to China was 2010.</span>
</div>
