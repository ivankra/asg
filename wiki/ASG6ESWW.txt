<!-- Expressing "almost" using "chadian" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

To say that something bad ''almost'' happened (but didn't), you can add the word 差点 (chàdiǎn) before the verb.  You will also hear 差点儿 (chàdiǎnr) in northern China.  There is no difference in meaning between 差点 and 差点儿.

== Literal Meaning ==

It might help to understand the literal meaning of the structure.  The word 差 has a lot of meanings. In this case, it means "to lack," or "to be short." So in Chinese, the way to say "almost" is to say, "lacking that little bit." If that "little bit" hadn't been lacking, it ''would have'' happened.  But it ''was'' lacking, so it didn't happen; it ''almost'' happened. Just remember: the fact of what really happened is always ''NOT'' the verb phrase after 差点(儿).

== Structure ==

Note that the "[[Predicate]]" part of the structure is usually something bad or something you don't wish for, and that it '''didn't happen'''.

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 差点 + Predicate 
</div>

You can put 了 at the end of the sentence for emphasis. In this case, 就 is often used and it's optional.

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 差点 (+就) + Predicate + 了
</div>

The [[predicate]] part of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective.

== Using 差点 with 没 ==

This can get confusing, even though it's really the same pattern (and same logic) with a little added complexity. This pattern goes beyond the difficulty level of the needs of the B1 learner, so to learn more about this usage, see [[Expressing "almost" using "chadian mei"|expressing "almost" using "chadian mei."]]
