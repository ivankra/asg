<!-- Expressing "toward" with "wang" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

Although 往 (wǎng) simply means "towards," it's not used as often as certain other [[preposition]]s and also has a few special use cases, so it warrants a little extra attention.

== Used as "Towards" ==

往 (wǎng) is a preposition that means "towards" and precedes the [[verb]] it modifies.

=== Used before a Verb ===

This is the common one used in everyday speech.

==== Structure ====

Adding 往 (wǎng) with a location or place word indicates the direction of an action. Remember that the verb comes ''after'' this 往 phrase.

</div>

=== Used after a Verb ===

In written language,  往 (wǎng) can also be used ''after'' a few monosyllabic verbs, which are then followed by [[location noun]]s.

Verb + 往 + Direction / Place

== 往下 as "Keep Going" ==

往下 (wǎng xià) expresses "keep going," implying that the process has been interrupted before. The verbs that follow are usually communication or sensory verbs: speak (说), read (读), write (写), watch (看), and listen (听) are common.

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

*<em>往</em> 下 <strong>说</strong> 。<span class="pinyin"><em>Wǎng</em> xià <strong>shuō</strong>.</span><span class="trans">Keep talking.</span>
*<em>往</em> 下 <strong>读</strong> 。 <span class="pinyin"><em>Wǎng</em> xià <strong>dú</strong>.</span><span class="trans">Keep reading.</span>
*你 <em>往</em> 下 <strong>看</strong> 就 知道 了 。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>wǎng</em> xià <strong>kàn</strong> jiù zhīdào le.</span><span class="trans">Keep reading and you'll see.</span>
