<!-- Doing something less with "shao" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

The word 少 (shǎo) can mean "few," but when placed before a verb, it takes on the meaning of "less" as in "to do less (of something)." It is often heard when scolding or giving advice (like when parents talk to children). What's not intuitive to learners is that the word 少 should come ''before the verb.''

== Structure ==

Just as you can use 多 to talk about [[Doing something more with "duo"|doing something more]], you can use 少 to talk about doing something ''less''.

<div class="jiegou">
少 + Verb 
</div>

Note that in English, we don't use the word "less" very much.  For example, rather than saying "drink less water," we might say "don't drink so much water."  In Chinese, though, using 少 is quite natural and common.  Avoiding the negative command (telling someone ''not'' to do something) is also a subtle way of sounding less bossy and annoying in Chinese.

== Colloquial Sayings ==

These set phrases are worth special note, because although they follow the grammar pattern, they might not make sense to you without a little extra explanation, just like the meaning of "come on" might not make sense at first to someone learning English.
