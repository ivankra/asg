<!-- Expressing "a full" with "zuzu" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 
{{Stub}}
Sometimes in English, we may want to emphasize how big, small, long, etc. something is perceived to be. We have all heard expressions like "he was a full 300 pounds," or "he was all of seven feet tall." The "a full" and "all of" in these sentences have an equivalent expression in Chinese: 足足 (zúzú).

==Structure==

You can put 足足 either in front or after the verb. Remember that 足足 adds emphasis to what you are saying, so you should always use it with a number. Some more commonly used verbs are 有 and 等.
