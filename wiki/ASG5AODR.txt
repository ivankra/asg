When a verb is done more than once, it also requires a measure word to accompany it. This way the measure word is acting as a way to count the frequency or re-occurrence of an action. The most basic one you probably already know is 次 (cì).

== Structure ==

<div class="jiegou">
Verb + Number + Measure Word 
</div>

The grammar pattern is very similar to English. For example, "看三次" and "saw three times" mirror each other in structure. In Chinese sentences, these measure words come after the verb. You should also know that, like nouns, some verbs have special measure words to go with them. The basic verbal measure word, however, is 次, as in the number of "times" something is done or happens.

Common verb measure words include 次 (cì), 遍 (biàn), and 下 (xià).
