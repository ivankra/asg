<!-- Expressing "be going to" with "yao" -->
{{Grammar Box}}

The [[auxiliary verb]] 要 (yào) has [[Auxiliary verb "yao" and its multiple meanings|several different meanings]], and here we'll tackle the "be going to" meaning. You'll use this when you are discussing your plans with someone.

== Structure ==

The idea behind this usage of 要 (yào) is that someone is "planning to" or "going to" or "preparing to" do something.  It's not that they just ''want to'', or ''have to'', it's that they fully expect to do it.  It's in their plan.

This usage of 要 (yào) typically includes a [[time noun|time word]] of some sort, which may be placed before or after the subject. This is fairly logical; if you're discussing plans for the future, you're quite likely to say when you plan to do things.

Note that the time word is not strictly required, and when it's missing, you may at first find yourself wondering [[Auxiliary verb "yao" and its multiple meanings|which usage of 要 (yào)]] you're dealing with. This is normal; it just takes some getting used to.
