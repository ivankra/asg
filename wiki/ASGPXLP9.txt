<!-- Expressing "must" with "dei" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

The auxiliary verb 得 (děi) means "must." Yes, it's annoying that the same character can also be pronounced "de," but at least when you use 得 (děi), there's no [[Auxiliary verb "yao" and its multiple meanings|ambiguity like with the word 要 (yào)]].

== Structure ==

Normally, when you see 得, it's a particle and is pronounced "de." However, it can also be an [[auxiliary verb]]. In this case it's pronounced "děi" and means "must."
