== Colloquial Saying ==

In spoken Chinese, the rhetorical question, "这还用说吗？" indicates the speaker believes that the statement is obvious. It is equivalent to the speaker saying, "does that even need to be said?" or "is that seriously a question?" This 用 is the direct opposite of the 不用 in this grammar point, but you don't hear it a lot.
