<!-- Using "dui" with verbs -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

When using 对 (duì) as a [[preposition]], it means "to" or "towards" an object or target. As with all prepositions, you've got to watch out when using this word, as usage of 对 in Chinese doesn't always totally "make sense" or correspond to English at all.

== Basic Usage ==

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 对 + Person + Verb 
</div>

Note that you shouldn't be plugging in just any old verb here; the ones that work with 对 are limited.

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

*宝宝 <em>对</em> <strong>我</strong> 笑 了 。<span class="pinyin">Bǎobao <em>duì</em> <strong>wǒ</strong> xiào le.</span><span class="trans">The baby smiled at me.</span>
*小狗 在 <em>对</em> <strong>你</strong> 叫 。<span class="pinyin">Xiǎogǒu zài <em>duì</em> <strong>nǐ</strong> jiào.</span><span class="trans">The dog is barking at you.</span>
*你 不 应该 这样 <em>对</em> <strong>父母</strong> 说话 。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ bù yīnggāi zhèyàng <em>duì</em> <strong>fùmǔ</strong> shuōhuà.</span><span class="trans">You shouldn't talk to your parents this way.</span>
*他 总是 <em>对</em> <strong>老师</strong> 撒谎 。<span class="pinyin">Tā zǒngshì <em>duì</em> <strong>lǎoshī</strong> sāhuǎng.</span><span class="trans">He always lies to his teachers.</span>
*不要 <em>对</em> <strong>孩子</strong> 发脾气 。<span class="pinyin">Bùyào <em>duì</em> <strong>háizi</strong> fā píqi.</span><span class="trans">Don't lose your temper with the child.</span>

</div>

== Colloquial Expression 对……来说 ==

In English we often start sentences with "to someone" or "for someone" when sharing that person's perspective. In Chinese, the pattern is:

<div class="jiegou">
对 + Person + 来说 ，⋯⋯ 
</div>

While this pattern was too common to omit from this page, it's covered in more depth as part of [[Phrases using "laishuo"|phrases using "laishuo."]] 

== Usage with Specific Verbs ==

Certain verbs, especially [[psychological verb]]s, are often used with 对, which means 对 is needed if you want to add an object into the structure. I good example is 对……感兴趣 ("to be interested in..."). In this case, 对 means "in," "on," "about," etc., and the object doesn't have to be a person. The short list below will give a few more verbs frequently paired with 对.

=== Structures ===

* 对⋯⋯有兴趣 (yǒu xìngqù)  to have an interest in...
* 对⋯⋯感兴趣 (gǎn xìngqù)  to feel interested in...
* 对⋯⋯负责 (fùzé)  to be responsible for...
* 对⋯⋯满意 (mǎnyì)  to feel satisfied with...
* 对⋯⋯失望 (shīwàng) to be disappointed in/with...
* 对⋯⋯好奇 (hàoqí) to be curious about...

=== Examples ===

Some example sentences:

<div class="liju">

*我 儿子 <em>对</em> 学 外语 很 <strong>感 兴趣</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ érzi <em>duì</em> xué wàiyǔ hěn <strong>gǎn xìngqù</strong>.</span><span class="trans">My son is very interested in learning foreign languages.</span>
*你 应该 <em>对</em> 自己 的 工作 <strong>负责</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ yīnggāi <em>duì</em> zìjǐ de gōngzuò <strong>fùzé</strong> .</span><span class="trans">You should be responsible for your job.</span>
*老板 <em>对</em> 你 不 太 <strong>满意</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Lǎobǎn <em>duì</em> nǐ bù tài <strong>mǎnyì</strong>.</span><span class="trans">The boss is not very satisfied with you.</span>
*观众 <em>对</em> 比赛 结果 非常 <strong>失望</strong> 。<span class="pinyin">Guānzhòng <em>duì</em> bǐsài jiéguǒ fēicháng <strong>shīwàng</strong>.</span><span class="trans">The audience is very disappointed with the result of the game.</span>
