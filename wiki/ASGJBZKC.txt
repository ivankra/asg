<!-- Expressing "and also" with "hai" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

In English we use "and also" when we want to connect separate and different thoughts. We can do the same thing in Chinese by using 还 (hái). 

== Structure ==

The adverb 还 (hái) can be used to link two phrases together, in a similar way to "and also" in English. In this case, 还 (hái) begins a new phrase or clause.

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + Verb + Obj. 1， 还 + Verb + Obj. 2

== The Difference Between 还 (hái) and 也 (yě) ==

It should be noted that another common way to express "also" is with the word 也 (yě).  What's the difference? With 还 (hái), ONE subject is doing TWO different things, whereas when [[The "also" adverb "ye"|也 (yě)]] is used, TWO subjects are doing ONE thing. 

It's the difference between these two English sentences:

* He fixed dinner '''and also''' washed the dishes.
* She washed the dishes '''too'''.

If you translated these into Chinese, the first one (one subject, two actions) would use 还 (hái), and the second one (second subject, no new actions) would use 也 (yě). Let's do that!

<div class="liju">

* 他 做 了 饭 ， <em>还</em> 洗 了 碗。<span class="pinyin">Tā zuò le fàn, <em>hái</em> xǐ le wǎn.</span><span class="trans">He fixed dinner and also washed the dishes.</span>
* 她 <em>也</em> 洗 了 碗。<span class="pinyin">Tā <em>yě</em> xǐ le wǎn.</span><span class="trans">She washed the dishes too.</span>

</div>

How about a few more similar examples?

<div class="liju">

* 我 洗 了 澡， <em>还</em> 洗 了 衣服。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ xǐ le zǎo, <em>hái</em> xǐ le yīfu.</span><span class="trans"> I took a shower and also did my laundry.</span>
* 她 <em>也</em> 洗 了 衣服。<span class="pinyin">Tā <em> yě</em> xǐ le yīfu.</span><span class="trans">She did her laundry too.</span>

</div>

<div class="liju">

* 我们 今天 晚上 出去 吃饭 了，<em>还</em> 看 了 电影 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒmen jīntiān wǎnshang chūqù chīfàn le, <em>hái</em> kàn le diànyǐng.</span><span class="trans">We went out for dinner tonight and also watched a movie.</span>
* 他们 今天 晚上 <em>也</em> 看 了 电影 。 <span class="pinyin">Tāmen jīntiān wǎnshang <em>yě</em> kàn le diànyǐng.</span><span class="trans">They watched a movie tonight too.</span>
