Both 常常 (chángcháng) and 经常 (jīngcháng) are [[adverb]]s expressing the idea of "often," though their usage differs in some small details. 

== Used as an Adverb ==

常常 and 经常 both can be used to express frequency, meaning "often," and that the time between each instance something happens is very short. In this case, they are interchangeable. 

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
常常 / 经常 + Verb
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

*我 <em>常常</em> 收到 垃圾 短信 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>chángcháng</em> shōudào lājī duǎnxìn.</span><span class="trans">I often receive spam texts.</span>
*你们 <em>经常</em> 加班 吗 ？<span class="pinyin">Nǐmen <em>jīngcháng</em> jiābān ma?</span><span class="trans">Do you guys often work overtime?</span>
*他们 <em>常常</em> 吵架 。<span class="pinyin">Tāmen <em>chángcháng</em> chǎojià.</span><span class="trans">They often argue.</span>

</div>

Neither 常常 nor 经常 can be placed before the subject:

<div class="liju">
<ul>
<li class="x"><em>常常</em> 他 不 吃 早饭 。<span class="pinyin"><em>Chángcháng</em> tā bù chī zǎo fàn.</span></li>
<li class="x"><em>经常</em> 他 不 吃 早饭 。<span class="pinyin"><em>Jīngcháng</em> tā bù chī zǎo fàn.</span></li>
<li class="o">他 <em>经常</em> 不 吃 早饭 。<span class="pinyin">Tā <em>jīngcháng</em> bù chī zǎo fàn.</span><span class="trans">He often skips breakfast.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

Note that 常 (by itself) is used for ''future'' frequent actions in colloquial Chinese.

<div class="liju">
*<em>常</em> 来 玩 ！<span class="pinyin"><em>Cháng</em> lái wán!</span><span class="trans">Come hang out often!</span>
*<em>常</em> 联系 ！<span class="pinyin"><em>Cháng</em> liánxì!</span><span class="trans">Let's keep in touch!</span>
</div>

== Used as an Adjective ==

Although not so commonly used in this way, 经常 can also be used as an adjective referring to things that happens very frequently. 常常 can't be used this way.

A simple example:

<div class="liju">

*她 忘 带 钥匙 是 <em>经常</em> 的 事情 。<span class="pinyin">Tā wàng dài yàoshi shì <em>jīngcháng</em> de shìqing.</span><span class="trans">It's a regular thing for her to forget to bring her keys.</span>

</div>

== Negative Form ==

经常 and 常常 can share the same negative form '''不常'''. You can also simply use 不 to negate both 经常 and 常常, although 不常常 is not super common.

A few examples:

<div class="liju">
*他 <em>不 常</em> 抽烟 。<span class="pinyin">Tā <em>bù cháng</em> chōuyān.</span><span class="trans">He doesn't smoke very often.</span>
*我 妈妈 <em>不 经常</em> 网购 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ māma <em>bù jīngcháng</em> wǎng gòu.</span><span class="trans">My mother doesn't often shop online.</span>
</div>
