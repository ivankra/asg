<!-- Questions with "ne" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

The particle 呢 (ne) can be used to ask reciprocal questions, also known as "bounce back" questions. 呢 (ne) can also be used to form simple questions asking "what about...?" or "how about...?"

== General Questions with 呢 (ne) ==

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Topic + 呢 ？
</div>

And it's as simple as that. Say what you want to ask about, then stick 呢 (ne) on the end. A very common way to use this is to return a question after being asked it. The classic example is this exchange:

<div class="liju">

<ul class="dialog">
<li><span class="speaker">A:</span> 你 好 吗 ？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ hǎo ma?</span></li> 
<li><span class="speaker">B:</span> 我 很 好 。你 <em>呢</em> ？<span class="pinyin">Wǒ hěn hǎo. Nǐ <em>ne</em>?</span></li>
<li><span class="speaker">A:</span> 我 也 很 好 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ yě hěn hǎo.</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

=== Examples ===

More 呢 (ne) examples (each of these can be translated as a "what about" question):

<div class="liju">

* 这 个 很 好 ， 那 个 <em>呢</em> ？<span class="pinyin">Zhège hěn hǎo, nàge <em>ne</em>?</span><span class="trans">This one is good. What about that one?</span>
* 这 个 用 中文 怎么 说？那 个 <em>呢</em> ？<span class="pinyin">Zhège yòng Zhōngwén zěnme shuō? Nàge <em>ne</em>?</span><span class="trans">How do I say this in Chinese? And that?</span>

</div>

== Asking "Where" with 呢 (ne) ==

You'll occasionally hear someone seemingly using 呢 (ne) out of the blue. When this happens, they're usually asking ''where'' someone or something is, and they expect that you know what they're talking about and know where that person or thing is.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">

[Missing Person / Thing] + 呢 ？

</div>

=== Examples ===

This one is simple, so just a few examples are needed:

<div class="liju">

* 钱 <em>呢</em> ？<span class="pinyin">Qián <em>ne</em>?</span><span class="trans">Where's the money?</span>
* 你 妈妈 <em>呢</em> ？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ māma <em>ne</em>?</span><span class="trans">Where's your mom?</span>
* 我 的 手机 <em>呢</em> ？<span class="pinyin">Wǒ de shǒujī <em>ne</em>?</span><span class="trans">Where's my cell phone?</span>

</div>
