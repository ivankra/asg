<!-- Expressing "not often" with "bu zenme" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

You might be tempted to conclude that 不怎么 (bù zěnme) seems to mean "not how," but it actually means "not often" when used together with a verb.

== Structure ==

When 不怎么 is used with a verb, it means that one does not put a lot of time or energy into doing it. In other words, the action is done "not often." When the verb is used with an object, it also means that the number (or quantity) is really small.

</div>

== Usage of 没怎么 ==

Note that the examples below use 没 instead of 不. This is because the verb uses or implies 有 and  thus it uses the same [[Negation_of_"you"| the 有 negation rules]].

<div class="liju">

*我 <em>没 怎么</em> 复习 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>méi zěnme</em> fùxí.</span><span class="trans">I didn't review much.</span>
*我 <em>没 怎么</em> 想 过 这个 问题 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>méi zěnme</em> xiǎng guo zhège wèntí.</span><span class="trans">I didn't really think about this before.</span>
*昨天 我 肚子 不 舒服 ，<em>没 怎么</em> 吃 东西 。<span class="pinyin">Zuótiān wǒ dùzi bù shūfu, <em>méi zěnme</em> chī dōngxi.</span><span class="trans">My stomach didn't feel well yesterday, so I didn't eat much.</span>

</div>

Lastly, make sure to use 不怎么 with a verb if you want it to mean "not often." Using it with an adjective gives it a [["Not_very"_with_"bu_zenme" | different meaning]].
