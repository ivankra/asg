<!-- Measure word "ge" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 
个 (gè) is the most commonly used [[measure word]]. It can be used in a pinch for any noun if you can't think of a more precise measure word. (Although you might not sound quite as smart, you'll still get your point across). Also, for many nouns, 个 (gè) ''is'' the only correct measure word.

== Counting Nouns ==

=== Structure === 

The general structure for 个 (gè) and measure words in general is:

<div class="jiegou">

Number + 个 + Noun

</div>

Any time you want to state ''how many'' of a noun in Chinese, you probably need a measure word.  First get used to how they are used with 个 (gè).

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

* 一 <em>个</em> 人 <span class="pinyin">yī <em>gè</em> rén</span><span class="trans">one person</span>
* 四 <em>个</em> 朋友 <span class="pinyin">sì <em>gè</em> péngyou</span><span class="trans">four friends</span>
* 三 <em>个</em> 苹果 手机 <span class="pinyin">sān <em>gè</em> Píngguǒ shǒujī</span><span class="trans">three iPhones</span>
* 五 <em>个</em> 星期 <span class="pinyin">wǔ <em>gè</em> xīngqī</span><span class="trans">five weeks</span>
* 六 <em>个</em> 月 <span class="pinyin">liù <em>gè</em> yuè </span><span class="trans">six months</span>
* 两 <em>个</em> 老婆<span class="pinyin">liǎng <em>gè</em>  lǎopo </span><span class="trans">two wives</span>
* 十 <em>个</em> 男人， 七 <em>个</em> 傻， 八 <em>个</em> 坏。<span class="expl pdf-simple-expl">A line from a song</span><span class="pinyin">Shí <em>gè</em> nánrén, qī <em>gè</em> shǎ, bā <em>gè</em> huài.</span><span class="trans">Ten men: seven are fools, and eight are bad.</span>

</div>

== Omitting the Number ==

=== Structure === 

<div class="jiegou">

Verb + 个 + Noun

</div>

If the number is one (1), you can omit it and use 个 (gè) by itself. This is similar to "a" or "an" in English, for example in "a person" or "an idiot." (The tone on 个 (gè) is normally somewhat de-emphasized in this usage, but still written as fourth tone. You don't need to stress about it, though.)

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

* 他 是 <em>个</em> 老外。<span class="pinyin">Tā shì <em>gè</em> lǎowài.</span><span class="trans">He is a foreigner.</span>
* 我 有 <em>个</em> 儿子。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ yǒu <em>gè</em> érzi.</span><span class="trans">I have a son.</span>
* 她 是 <em>个</em> 好 老师。<span class="pinyin">Tā shì <em>gè</em> hǎo lǎoshī.</span><span class="trans">She is a good teacher.</span>
* 你 想 吃 <em>个</em> 包子 吗？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ xiǎng chī <em>gè</em> bāozi ma?</span><span class="trans">Would you like to eat a stuffed steamed bun?</span>
* 老师 ， 我 有 <em>个</em> 问题。<span class="pinyin">Lǎoshī, wǒ yǒu <em>gè</em> wèntí.</span><span class="trans">Teacher, I have a question.</span>

</div>
