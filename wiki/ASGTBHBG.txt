<!-- Comparing "zai" and "you" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

Both 再 (zài) and 又 (yòu) express the repeating of an action and can be roughly translated in English to "again."  However, 再 is used to express actions that have not yet occurred (the "future again") and 又 is used for actions that have already occurred (the "past again").  They're not interchangeable. In addition, each word has a few special usages. 

== 再 Expresses Repetition of an Action in the Future ==

再 is used to express something that [[Again in the future with "zai"|has already happened and will happen again]].

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 再 + Verb
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">
<ul>
<li>我们 下次 <em>再</em> 来 吧。<span class="pinyin">Wǒmen xiàcì <em>zài</em> lái ba.</span><span class="trans">We will come here again next time.</span></li>
<li>我 想 <em>再</em> 看 一下。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ xiǎng <em>zài</em> kàn yīxià.</span><span class="trans">I want to take another look.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

You need to use 再 for this usage; you can't use 又:

<div class="liju">
<ul>
<li class="x">请 <strong>又</strong> 说 一 次。<span class="expl">Since it is asking about a future action, you can't use "又"</span><span class="pinyin">Qǐng <strong>yòu</strong> shuō yī cì.</span></li>
<li class="o">请 <em>再</em> 说 一 次。<span class="pinyin">Qǐng <em>zài</em> shuō yī cì.</span><span class="trans">Please say it one more time.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

== 再 Can Express "Another" ==

Aside from expressing the repetition of an action, [[Again in the future with "zai"|再 can also be used to express the equivalent of the English word "another."]]

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 再 + Verb + Obj. 
</div>

Note that the "Object" mentioned above is usually also going to have an 一 and a [[measure word]] in front of it.  You'll see that in the examples below.

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

<ul>
<li class="o">我 要 <em>再</em> 看 一 部 电影。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ yào <em>zài</em> kàn yī bù diànyǐng.</span><span class="trans">I want to watch another movie.</span></li>

<li class="o"> 你 可以 <em>再</em> 做 一 碗 面条 吗 ？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ kěyǐ <em>zài</em> zuò yī wǎn miàntiáo ma?</span><span class="trans">Can you make another bowl of noodles?</span></li>

<li class="x"> 我 得 <strong>又</strong> 写 一 篇 作文。<span class="expl">Since it is about the future, you can't use "又"</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ děi <strong>yòu</strong> xiě yī piān zuòwén.</span><span class="trans">I have to write another essay.</span></li>

<li class="x"> 我 要 <strong>又</strong> 吃 一 块 蛋糕。<span class="expl">Since it is about the future, you can't use "又"</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ yào <strong>yòu</strong> chī yī kuài dàngāo.</span><span class="trans">I want to eat another piece of cake.</span></li>

</ul>
</div>

== 再 Can Express "And Then" ==

[[Sequencing with "xian" and "zai"|再 can be used with 先 to express sequential order]]. (ex. Do this....and then this....) In some cases, 再 can appear by itself to simply mean "and then."  While this doesn't sound so easy to confuse with 又, it's actually quite common for intermediate learners to misunderstand this use of 再 as meaning "again," so it's definitely worth mentioning here.

=== Structure === 

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + (先) + Action 1 + 再 + Action 2
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">
<ul>
<li class="o">我们 <strong>先</strong> 做 作业 <em>再</em> 去 爬山。<span class="pinyin">Wǒmen <strong>xiān</strong> zuò zuòyè <em>zài</em> qù páshān.</span><span class="trans">First we'll do our homework, then we'll go hiking in the mountains.</span></li>
<li class="o">我 <strong>先</strong> 买 房子 <em>再</em> 结婚。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <strong>xiān</strong> mǎi fángzi <em>zài</em> jiéhūn.</span><span class="trans">First I'll buy a house, then I'll get married.</span></li>
<li class="o">我们 吃 完 饭 <em>再</em> 看 电影。<span class="pinyin">Wǒmen chī wán fàn <em>zài</em> kàn diànyǐng ba.</span><span class="trans">We'll finish eating, then go see a movie.</span></li>
<li class="o">我们 回家 <em>再</em> 讨论，好 吗？<span class="pinyin">Wǒmen huíjiā <em>zài</em> tǎolùn, hǎo ma?</span><span class="trans">We can discuss it after we get home, OK?</span></li>
<li class="x">我 要 看 完 书 <em>又</em> 睡觉。<span class="expl">'"又"can not be used as the action"go to bed" haven't occured yet.</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ yào kàn wán shū <em>yòu</em> shuìjiào.</span><span class="trans">I want to finish reading the book and then go to sleep.</span></li>
<li class="x">你 <strong>先</strong> 吃饭 <em>又</em> 打 电话 给 父母。<span class="expl">"又" does not sequence events.</span><span class="pinyin">Nǐ <strong>xiān</strong> chīfàn <em>yòu</em> dǎ diànhuà gěi fùmǔ.</span><span class="trans">You should eat before you call your parents.</span></li> 
</ul>
</div>

== 又 Expresses Repetition of an Action That Has Already Occurred in the Past ==

又 is used in declarative sentences and describes the [[Again in the past with "you"|simple repetition of actions]]. This repeated action has already occurred once in the past.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 又 + Verb + 了
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">
<ul>
<li class="o">你 怎么 <em>又</em> 给 我 打 电话 了，什么事？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ zěnme <em>yòu</em> gěi wǒ dǎ diànhuà le, shénme shì?</span><span class="trans">Why do you keep calling me? What it it?</span></li>
<li class="o">这 个 人 <em>又</em> 来 了。<span class="pinyin">Zhège rén <em>yòu</em> lái le.</span><span class="trans">This guy is here again.</span></li>

<li class="o">你 为什么 <em>又</em> 看 这 本 书 了？ 你 已经 看 过 了。 <span class="pinyin">Nǐ wèishénme <em>yòu</em> kàn zhè  běn shū le? nǐ yǐjīng kàn guò le.</span><span class="trans">Why are you reading that book again？You've already read it.</span></li>

</ul>
</div>

== 又 Adds Emotional Coloring to Events Recurring in the Future ==

又 is sometimes used to express that something that has happened before ''is going to happen'' in the immediate future.  In this case, it usually appears with 要 (yào), 可以 (kěyǐ), 能 (néng), or 是 (shì).  This usage often expresses exasperation or impatience with something happening ''yet '''again''''', but sometimes it's more neutral, or even happy.
