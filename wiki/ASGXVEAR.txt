== 要 (yào) and 想 (xiǎng) ==

Instead of using 要 (yào), it is also possible to use the word 想 (xiǎng). These two words are largely interchangeable, and both can mean "to want." The small difference is that 要 (yào) is often used for something you want to or ''need'' to do, and ''plan to take action on''. It can sound a bit more demanding (and less polite). 想 (xiǎng) on the other hand, often conveys an idea on one's mind, that one ''may or may not take action on''. You can think of it as meaning "would like to."

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

* 我 <em>要</em> 喝 咖啡 。 <span class="expl">I am going to get my hands on some coffee</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>yào</em> hē kāfēi.</span><span class="trans">I want to drink coffee.</span>
* 我 <em>想</em> 喝 咖啡 。 <span class="expl">I want to drink a cup of coffee, but may or may not act on that</span><span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>xiǎng</em> hē kāfēi.</span><span class="trans">I'd like to drink coffee.</span>
* 你 <em>要</em> 吃 什么 ？ <span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>yào</em> chī shénme?</span><span class="trans">What do you want to eat?</span>
* 你 <em>想</em> 吃 什么 ？ <span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>xiǎng</em> chī shénme?</span><span class="trans">What would you like to eat?</span>
