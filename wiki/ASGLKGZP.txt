<!-- Doing something more with "duo" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

In China, you often hear you should do this or that more (eat more, drink more water, wear more warm clothing, etc.), and they often use the word 多 (duō). What's not intuitive to learners is that the word 多 should come ''before the verb.''

== Structure ==

This structure is often used in commands or suggestions.  Note the position of 多:

<div class="jiegou">
多 + Verb 
</div>

This structure is not used exclusively as a command, so you could also include a subject if you needed to.

== Examples ==

In English we like to say things like "eat ''more''," "drink ''more'' beer," and "I need to exercise ''more''."  Notice that in every one of these cases, the word "more" (equivalent to this use of 多) comes ''after'' the verb in English.  In Chinese, it's more natural to put the 多 ''before'' the verb.

<div class="liju">

*<em>多</em> 吃 点 。<span class="pinyin"><em>Duō</em> chī diǎn.</span><span class="trans">Eat a little more.</span>

</div>

== Counter-Examples ==

Just to be completely clear, the following uses of 多 are not as natural as the ones above.  They'll be understood, and they might not be technically ''wrong'', but you can do better!

<div class="liju">

<ul>
<li class="q">吃 <em>多</em> 点。<span class="pinyin">Chī <em>duō</em> diǎn.</span></li>
<li class="q"> 我 要 回家<em>多</em>点！<span class="pinyin">Wǒ yào huíjiā <em>duō</em> diǎn!</span></li>
<li class="q">我 应该 运动 <em>多</em> 点。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ yīnggāi yùndòng <em>duō</em> diǎn.</span></li>
</ul>

</div>

The opposite of 多 is, of course, 少.  It is further explained in the article [[doing something less with "shao"]].
