The word 给 (gěi) literally means "to give" but is frequently used in Chinese to indicate the ''target'' of a verb. The target is who or what the verb is aimed or directed at.

Chinese speakers use 给 in some interesting ways, similar to how English speakers use "to give," as in "to give someone a phone call" or "to give someone a reply."

== Alternative Structure ==

Although the structure above is the best one to learn first, some verbs frequently use 给 but have the 给 coming after the verb, rather than before. It's best to think of these as exceptions to the rule above, and you can learn more about these exceptions by reading about [[verbs followed by "gei"]].
