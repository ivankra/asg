<!-- Expressing "always" with "conglai" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

Although perhaps more often used in the negative to mean "[[never]]," 从来 (cónglái) can be used with [[都]] (dōu) to mean "always" or "have always (done)."

Without the negative adverbs [[不]] and [[没]], [[从来]] takes on the meaning of "[[always]]."  (Literally, 从来 means something like "from the beginning," although no one is really thinking that phrase when they use it.)  When used in the positive, though, it is customary to put the adverb 都 after 从来.

== Structure ==

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 从来 + 都 (是) + Predicate
</div>

The [[predicate]] part of the pattern can be a verb or an adjective. It's also quite common to follow 从来都 with an additional [[是]] for emphasis.
