==Structure with 凭着==

You can also add 着 to 凭 to make it 凭着, however when you do so you can only use it if the action has already been completed. If the action occurs habitually or has not happened yet, you cannot use 凭着. The structure is the same as using 凭 by itself. 

<div class="jiegou">
凭着 + Noun / Noun Phrase ……
</div>

== Examples ==

<div class="liju"> 
* 小白 <em>凭着</em> 自己 的 努力 致富 。<span class="pinyin">Xiǎo Bái <em>píngzhe</em> zìjǐ de nǔlì zhìfù.</span><span class="trans">On the basis of his own hard work, Xiao Bai was able to become rich.</span>
* 他 <em>凭着</em> 智慧 战胜 了 很 多 的 困难。<span class="pinyin">Tā <em>píngzhe</em> zhìhuì zhànshèng le hěn duō de kùnnan.</span><span class="trans">Using his intellect, he was able to overcome many difficulties.</span>
