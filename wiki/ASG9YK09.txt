<!-- The "all" adverb "dou" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

The adverb 都 (dōu) is used to express "all" in Chinese. It's common to use 都 (dōu) in a variety of sentences where it would seem unnecessary in English.

== 都 (dōu) for "All" ==

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + 都 + [Verb Phrase]

</div>

Remember that 都 (dōu) appears ''after'' the subject. A common mistake learners make is to put 都 (dōu) at the beginning of the sentence (as "all" often appears there in English). This isn't good Chinese - make sure you put 都 (dōu) after the subject and before the verb.

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

* 你们 <em>都</em> 认识 John 吗 ？<span class="pinyin">Nǐmen <em>dōu</em> rènshi John ma?</span><span class="trans">Do you all know John? </span>
* 他们 <em>都</em> 在 上海 。<span class="pinyin">Tāmen <em>dōu</em> zài Shànghǎi.</span><span class="trans">They are all in Shanghai.</span>
* 明天 我们 <em>都</em> 可以 去 。<span class="pinyin">Míngtiān wǒmen <em>dōu</em> kěyǐ qù.</span><span class="trans">Tomorrow we all can go.</span>
* 你们 <em>都</em> 用 wiki 吗 ？<span class="pinyin">Nǐmen <em>dōu</em> yòng wiki ma?</span><span class="trans">Do you all use the wiki? </span>
* 我们 <em>都</em> 要 冰水。<span class="pinyin">Wǒmen <em>dōu</em> yào bīngshuǐ .</span><span class="trans">We all want ice water.</span>

</div>

== 都 (dōu) for "Both" ==

Chinese doesn't normally use a special word for "both" like English does.  It just uses 都 (dōu) as if it were any other number greater than one.  Chinese also doesn't have a special pattern like "neither / nor" for the negative case.  Just use 都 (dōu) and make the sentence negative.  

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + 都 + [Verb Phrase]

</div>

This pattern should look familiar.

=== Examples ===

These examples follow exactly the same form in Chinese as the ones above.  The only difference is that here we don't translate 都 (dōu) as "all" in English; we translate it as "both," and for negative cases, we translate it as "neither."

<div class="liju">

* 我们 两 个 <em>都</em> 爱 你 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒmen liǎng gè <em>dōu</em> ài nǐ.</span><span class="trans">The two of us both love you.</span>
*  你 爸爸 和 你 妈妈 <em>都</em> 是 美国人 吗？<span class="pinyin"> Nǐ bàba hé nǐ māma <em>dōu</em> shì Měiguó rén ma?</span><span class="trans">Are your father and your mother both Americans? </span>
* 我 和 我 太太 <em>都</em>  不 吃 肉。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ hé wǒ tàitai <em>dōu</em> bù chī ròu.</span><span class="trans">Neither my wife nor I eat meat.</span>
* 你们 两个 <em>都</em> 喜欢 中国 菜 吗？<span class="pinyin">Nǐmen liǎng gè <em>dōu</em> xǐhuan Zhōngguó cài ma? </span><span class="trans">Do you both like Chinese food? </span>
*  她 和 她 老公 <em>都</em> 没有 工作。<span class="pinyin"> Tā hé tā lǎogōng <em>dōu</em>  méiyǒu gōngzuò.</span><span class="trans">Neither she nor her husband has a job.</span>

</div>
