The 要⋯⋯就⋯⋯ grammar structure can be used to express the same meaning as [["If…, then…" with "ruguo…, jiu…"|如果⋯⋯就]] However, 要⋯⋯就⋯⋯ is more intense and resolute, similar to imperative sentences (command sentences). Therefore, 要⋯⋯就⋯⋯ sentences typically do not have a subject, but they can have a topic. This grammar form is similar to the English "If you want to (verb) just (verb)..."
