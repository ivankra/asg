<!-- Expressing "now" with "le" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

现在 (xiànzài) isn't the only way to express "now."  You'll notice that in many common expressions, [[了|了 (le)]] is used in place of the word for "now."

== Structure ==

This pattern is actually the same as [[change of state with "le"]], but the examples below are somewhat idiomatic and can also easily be confused with a direct translation of "now" in Chinese, so they get special treatment here.

<div class="jiegou">
[New Situation] + 了
</div>

== Examples ==

<div class="liju">
