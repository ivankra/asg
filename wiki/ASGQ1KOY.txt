<!-- Expressing "just now" with "gangcai" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

In order to say that something "just now" occurred, use the [[Time noun|time noun]] 刚才 (gāngcái). It can be placed in front of the verb or the subject of a statement. 

== Structure ==

This grammar structure is pretty straightforward. Similar to the English "just now," you can put 刚才 (gāngcái) right before the verb in a sentence. It can also come before or after the subject.

<div class="jiegou">

刚才 + Verb

</div>

== Examples ==

<div class="liju">

* 你 <em>刚才</em> <strong>说</strong> 什么 了？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>gāngcái</em> <strong>shuō</strong> shénme le? </span><span class="trans">What did you just say? </span>

* <em>刚才</em> 有 人 <strong>找</strong> 你。<span class="pinyin"><em>Gāngcái</em> yǒu rén <strong> zhǎo</strong> nǐ.</span><span class="trans">Just now, there was someone looking for you.</span>

</div>

Note that for all of those cases, we're talking about something that happened ''just now'', as in, within the past 5 minutes or so. If you're talking about something that "just happened" yesterday or last week, don't use 刚才 (gāngcái), use [[Expressing "just" with "gang"|刚 (gāng)]].
