<!-- Comparing "yao" and "xiang" -->
{{Grammar Box}}

Both 要 (yào) and 想 (xiǎng) can essentially mean "want," but they can also be used in quite different ways, such as 想 (xiǎng) also meaning "to miss" when followed by a noun, and 要 (yào) also meaning "going to (do something)."

== Followed by a Noun ==

Both 要 (yào) and 想 (xiǎng) may be followed by nouns, but pay attention to how the meaning of 想 (xiǎng) totally changes when used this way.

=== 要 (yào) as "to Want" ===

==== Structure ====

In this pattern, 要 (yào) is directly followed by a thing (a noun), rather than by a verb. It is often used to buy something, or to order food at a restaurant.

It may be helpful to imagine a demanding child using this pattern to get stuff from his parents. This "''I want x!''" pattern can seem slightly impolite, but to the Chinese ear it's not as inherently rude as it may seem when translated directly into English. Tone of voice plays a key role when using this pattern in spoken Chinese.

</div>

=== 想 (xiǎng) as "to Miss" ===

'''Pay attention here:''' unlike "想 (xiǎng) + Verb," the meaning of 想 (xiǎng) in the "想 (xiǎng) + Noun" pattern becomes "to miss."

==== Structure ====

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 想 + Noun
</div>

==== Examples ====

<div class="liju">

* 我 <em>想</em> 你。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>xiǎng</em> nǐ.</span><span class="trans">I miss you.</span>
* 我 有点 <em>想</em> 我 的 家人。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ yǒudiǎn <em> xiǎng</em> wǒ de jiārén.</span><span class="trans">I sort of miss my family.</span>

</div>

== Followed by a Verb ==

要 (yào) and 想 (xiǎng) have similar meanings when followed by verbs. The difference is rather subtle, but 要 (yào) can sound more urgent or demanding (sometimes even childish), while 想 (xiǎng) is usually a bit more mature and polite. Tone of voice plays a big role here as well, though, so don't be afraid of offending people by using 要 (yào); the word itself isn't rude.

=== 要 (yào) as "Want to" ===

==== Structure ====

It might help to think of 要 (yào) in this sense as meaning "want to" and 想 (xiǎng) as meaning "would like to."

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 要 + Verb
</div>

==== Examples ====

<div class="liju">

* 我 <em>要</em> 休息 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>yào</em> xiūxi.</span><span class="trans">I want to rest.</span>
* 你 也 <em>要</em> 回家 吗 ？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ yě <em>yào</em> huíjiā ma? </span><span class="trans">Do you also want to go home? </span>

* 大家 晚上 <em>要</em> 不 <em>要</em> 出去 吃 ？<span class="pinyin">Dàjiā wǎnshang <em>yào</em> bu <em>yào</em> chūqù chī? </span><span class="trans">Does everyone want to go out to eat tonight? </span>

</div>

=== 想 (xiǎng) as "Would Like to" ===

==== Structure ====

It might help to think of 想 (xiǎng) as meaning "would like to" instead of "want to." In English, as well, "would like to" feels more indirect, and thus less demanding and more more polite.

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 想 + Verb
</div>

==== Examples ====

<div class="liju">

* 你 <em>想</em> 去 吗 ？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>xiǎng</em> qù ma? </span><span class="trans">Would you like to go? </span>
* 我 不 <em>想</em> 见 她 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ bù <em>xiǎng</em> jiàn tā.</span><span class="trans">I wouldn't like to see her.</span>
* 周末 你们 <em>想</em> 看 电影 吗 ？<span class="pinyin">Zhōumò nǐmen <em>xiǎng</em> kàn diànyǐng ma? </span><span class="trans">Would you like to see a movie this weekend? </span>

</div>

=== 要 (yào) as "Going to" ===

要 is used to indicate plans for the near future, much like "going to" in English. 想 (xiǎng) is not used in this way.

==== Structure ====

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 要 + Verb
</div>

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 想要 + Noun / Verb
