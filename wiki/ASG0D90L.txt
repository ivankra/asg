<!-- Expressing the unexpected with "jingran" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

To express something is unexpected, you can use the adverb 竟然 (jìngrán) after the subject. 竟然 has the same meaning as 居然, but is not as intense.

== Structure ==

Like many other adverbs, 竟然 is placed after the subject. This grammar structure is usually used in spoken Chinese. 

<div class="jiegou">
Subj. + 竟然 ⋯⋯
</div>

You can also drop out the 然 and use just 竟. This can be used in spoken or written Chinese.

== Examples ==

Note that it can be difficult to translate the word 竟然 into an appropriate English word. Sometimes it's just a ''feeling'' that doesn't come across well in English unless you can hear the tone of voice.

<div class="liju">

*没想到 你 <em>竟然</em> 当 着 老师 的 面 撒谎 。<span class="trans">I didn't expect you could lie in front of the teacher's face.</span>
*这 是 一 件 让 人 难过 的 事情 ，你 <em>竟然</em> 还 笑 ？<span class="trans">This is something that makes people sad, but you are actually laughing?</span>
*他 那么 努力 ，<em>竟然</em> 没 考 及格 ！<span class="trans">He is so hardworking, but, surprisingly, he didn't pass the exam.</span> 
*那个人 骗 了 你 的 钱 ，你 <em>竟</em> 不 生 他 的 气 ？<span class="trans">You got ripped off by that guy.</span>
*大家 都 以为 他 不 会 答应 ，可是 他 <em>竟然</em> 答应 了 。<span class="trans">Everyone thought he would say no,  but he said yes.</span>
*这么 复杂 的 项目 ，<em>竟然</em> 这么 快 就 完成 了 。<span class="trans">This project is so complex, but it's been completed so soon.</span>

</div>
