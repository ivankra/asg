The verb 姓 (xìng) literally means "to be surnamed" or "to have the surname." It may seem awkward at first that there's a verb just for this, but you'll find that it's used quite often in Chinese.

== Giving One's Surname ==

姓 (xìng) is used most often to tell someone your own surname ("family name" or "last name"), or to ask the surname of someone else.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + 姓 + [Surname]

</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

*我 <em>姓</em> 王。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>xìng</em> Wáng.</span><span class="trans">My family name is Wang.</span>
*你 老板 <em>姓</em> 李 吗？<span class="pinyin"> Nǐ lǎobǎn <em>xìng</em> Lǐ ma?</span><span class="trans">Is your boss's last name Li?</span>
*那 个 帅哥 <em>姓</em> 张。<span class="pinyin">Nàge shuàigē <em>xìng</em> Zhāng.</span><span class="trans">That handsome guy's last name is Zhang.</span>
*我 爸爸 <em>姓</em> 周，我 妈妈 <em>姓</em> 林 。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ bàba <em>xìng</em> Zhōu, wǒ māma <em>xìng</em> Lín.</span><span class="trans">My father's family name is Zhou. My mother's family name is Lin.</span>
*他 女朋友 <em>姓</em> 钱。<span class="pinyin">Tā nǚpéngyou <em>xìng</em> Qián.</span><span class="trans">His girlfriend's last name is Qian.</span>
*你好，我 <em>姓</em> 毛。<span class="pinyin">Nǐ hǎo, wǒ <em>xìng</em> Máo.</span><span class="trans">Hello. My last name is Mao.</span>
*我 <em>姓</em> 赵，我 太太 也 <em>姓</em> 赵。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>xìng</em> Zhào, wǒ tàitai yě <em>xìng</em> Zhào.</span><span class="trans">My last name is Zhao. My wife's last name is also Zhao.</span>
*我 的 中文 老师 <em>姓</em> 陈。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ de Zhōngwén lǎoshī <em>xìng</em> Chén.</span><span class="trans">My Chinese teacher's surname is Chen.</span>
*你 奶奶 也 <em>姓</em> 陈 吗 ？<span class="pinyin"> Nǐ nǎinai yě <em>xìng</em> Chén ma?</span><span class="trans">Is your grandma's family name also Chen?</span>
*他们 都 <em>姓</em> 李。<span class="pinyin">Tāmen dōu <em>xìng</em> Lǐ.</span><span class="trans">All of their surnames are Li.</span>

</div>

== Asking Someone's Surname ==

You can also use 姓 (xìng) to ask people their surnames. You could do this quite directly by saying:

<div class="liju">

* 你 姓 什么? <span class="pinyin">Nǐ xìng shénme?</span><span class="trans">What is your last name?</span>

</div>

However, the formal way to ask has a set form:

<div class="liju">

* 您 贵 姓 ？<span class="pinyin">Nín guì xìng?</span><span class="trans">What is your honorable surname?</span>

</div>

Literally this means "What is your honorable surname?" Use this form to be polite when asking people their surnames.
