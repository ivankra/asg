<!-- Auxiliary verb "yao" and its multiple meanings -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

You probably already know the basic meaning of [[Wanting to do something with "yao"|要 (yào)]] as "to want."  It is actually a quite versatile word, though, and can also take on the meanings of "to need" as well as "will (do something)."  In every case, context is crucial for figuring out which meaning someone is trying to express.

== 要 (yào) as "Want" ==

This structure could be used when ordering food at a restaurant or a shop. Here, it's being used for saying that you want ''something.''

</div>

== 要 (yào) as "Want to" ==

In Chinese, 要 (yào) can mean "want to" (similar to  [[Expressing "would like to" with "xiang"|想 (xiǎng)]]), but its tone is quite firm. So it's used for saying that you want '''''to do''' something''.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + 要 + Verb

</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

* 你 <em>要</em> 喝 什么 酒？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>yào</em> hē shénme jiǔ? </span><span class="trans">What kind of wine do you want to drink? </span>

</div>

== 要 (yào) as "Need to" ==

If you crank the urgency of "to want" up a few notches, you get "to need."  The two meanings overlap, creating a fuzzy, "needy" gray area.

</div>

== 要 (yào) as "Going to" ==

This use of 要 (yào) is like "going to" (similar to [[Expressing "will" with "hui"|会]] (huì)).

=== Structure ===

Again, no change to the structure here, but it often includes a mention of a time ''when'' something is ''going to happen''.

</div>

== Context, Context, Context ==

You may have noticed that the meanings can easily overlap. To figure out what is intended, you need to use context.  How urgent is the situation?  Is it likely to be something the speaker really ''wants'' to do?  Is it something that's totally ''going to'' happen, regardless of anyone's preference?  Most often, a little background knowledge and some common sense are all you need to figure it out.
