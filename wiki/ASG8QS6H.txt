总 (zǒng) can often be simply translated as "[[always]]," but it has other advanced uses as well. It can express "no matter how long or under what circumstances, facts are facts." It can also express "no matter what."  It is often paired with other words to form set phrases such as 总会, 总归, 总得, 总要, 总能, etc. It can also be structured together with other unconditional compound phrases like [[无论]] and [[不管]]. You cannot place it directly after the verb. 

== Used with Auxiliary Verb ==

In this structure, 总, with its companion character (usually a modal/[[auxiliary verb]]), means "always will (fill in character/action here)" Once again, it gives the feeling of something very concrete and factual. As you'll see in the examples, below, however, the word "always" don't always work well in a natural translation to English.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
总 + 会 / 得 / 要 / 能 + Verb Phrase (+ 吧)
</div>

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

*这里 是 他 家，他 <em>总 会</em> 回来 的。<span class="pinyin">Zhèlǐ shì tā jiā, tā <em>zǒng huì</em> huílái de.</span><span class="trans">This is his home. He will always come back.</span>

</div>

== Used with 不 and 没 ==

When 总 is used together with a negating word (like 不 or 没), it often has a tone of speculation, judgment or suggestion. The sentence often ends with a 吧.

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">
总 + 不 / 没 + Verb
</div>

<div class="liju">

*你们 之间 的 联系 这么 少，看 起来 <em>总</em> <strong>不</strong> 像 是 一 家 人。<span class="pinyin">Nǐmen zhī jiān de liánxì zhème shǎo, kàn qǐlái <em>zǒng</em> <strong>bù</strong> xiàng shì yī jiā rén.</span><span class="trans">You talk to each other so little. It seems that you're barely family. </span>
