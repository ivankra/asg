{{Grammar Box}}

You may know how to make [[negative commands with "bie"|negative commands with "bie,"]] but what if someone is already doing it? The pattern 别⋯⋯了 (bié... le) is all you need to tell someone to ''STOP DOING THAT'' (which they're already doing).

</div>

Instead of just a [[verb]], it can also be a verb phrase.

</div>

== Other Meaning ==
