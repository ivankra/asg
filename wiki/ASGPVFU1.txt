<!-- In the future in general with "yihou" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

Similar to talking about things in the past, talking about things in the future is very straight forward. You can use the simple but useful  以后 (yǐhòu), which also means "later."

== Structure ==

To talk about things happening at some unspecified time in the future, you can use 以后 (yǐhòu). The structure is:

<div class="jiegou">

以后 + Subj. + Verb + Obj.

</div>

You can also move 以后 (yǐhòu) to right after the subject, and it's also correct.

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + 以后 + Verb + Obj.

</div>

This can be used to talk about actions in the future, or to talk about events that happened ''after other events'' in a story.

== Examples ==

In the examples below, the translation "in the future" is used, because using "later" for 以后 (yǐhòu) either sounds weird, or makes it sound like it's going to happen really soon (just a little later), rather than at some indefinite point in the future, which is what is meant.

<div class="liju">

* <em>以后</em> 你们 会  想我 吗？ <span class="pinyin"><em>Yǐhòu</em> nǐmen huì xiǎng wǒ ma? </span><span class="trans">In the future, will you miss me? </span>
