<!-- Indicating location with "zai" before verbs -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

If you need to include the place where an action takes place, you can use 在 (zài). Just pay close attention to [[Basic sentence order|word order]], as this is one case in which Chinese word order is quite different from English.

== Structure ==

To indicate the location that a verb takes place in, 在 (zài), followed by a location, comes before the verb.

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + 在 + Place + Verb + Obj.

</div>

Notice that the location is placed ''before'' the verb in Chinese, whereas in English it appears ''afterwards''.

== Examples ==

<div class="liju">

* 我 <em>在</em> <strong>上海</strong> 上大学。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>zài</em> <strong>Shànghǎi</strong> shàng dàxué.</span><span class="trans">I went to college in Shanghai.</span>

* 现在 我们 <em>在</em> <strong>KTV</strong> 唱歌。<span class="pinyin">Xiànzài wǒmen <em>zài</em> <strong>KTV</strong> chànggē.</span><span class="trans">Now we're singing songs at karaoke.</span>
* 老板 <em>在</em> <strong>会议室</strong> 见 客户。<span class="pinyin">Lǎobǎn <em>zài</em> <strong>huìyìshì</strong> jiàn kèhù.</span><span class="trans">The boss is seeing the client in the meeting room.</span>

</div>

Remember: in English we usually put the location at the end of a sentence. In Chinese, we put the location after the subject but ''before'' the verb.

== Getting More Specific with Locations ==

Rather than just using 在 (zài) to mean "at" a location, you might want to use it to mean "in," "on," or "under" a specific location. To do this, you'll need to add an extra word after the location. Learn about  [[expressing location with "zai... shang / xia / li"]].
