<!-- Expressing a learned skill with "hui" -->
{{Grammar Box}} 

The word 会 (huì) can be used to express an ability that has been learned (a skill). In this case 会 (huì) is an [[auxiliary verb]].

== Basic Usage ==

=== Structure ===

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + 会 + Verb + Obj.

</div>

This structure is the easiest way to express all kinds of skills, from languages, to sports, to skills in daily life such as cooking and driving.

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

* 他 <em>会</em> 说 中文。<span class="pinyin">Tā <em>huì</em> shuō Zhōngwén.</span><span class="trans">He can speak Chinese.</span>
* 我 <em>会</em> 写 汉字。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ <em>huì</em> xiě Hànzì.</span><span class="trans">I can write Chinese characters.</span>
* 你 <em>会</em> 做饭 吗？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>huì</em> zuòfàn ma?</span><span class="trans">Can you cook food？</span>
* 狗 <em>会</em> 唱 歌 吗？<span class="pinyin">Gǒu <em>huì</em> chànggē ma?</span><span class="trans">Can dogs sing？</span>
* 爸爸 <em>会</em> 开车。<span class="pinyin">Bàba <em>huì</em> kāichē.</span><span class="trans"> Dad can drive.</span>

</div>

== Negating 会 (huì) Sentences ==

=== Structure ===

会 (huì) sentences are [[Standard negation with "bu"|negated with 不 (bù)]], which is inserted in front of 会 (huì):

<div class="jiegou">

Subj. + 不 + 会 + Verb + Obj.

</div>

Again, this is the simplest way to express the lack of a learned ability. So while "can't" is a natural translation for "不会" (bù huì) in English, "don't know how to" is equally correct (and perhaps more helpful).

Also, due to a [http://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/Tone_change_rules tone change rule] for "不" (bù), the phrase "不会" (bù huì) is actually pronounced "bú huì."

=== Examples ===

<div class="liju">

* 我 <em>不会</em> 说 英文。<span class="pinyin"> Wǒ <em>bù huì</em> shuō Yīngwén.</span><span class="trans">I can't speak English.</span>
* 妈妈 <em>不会</em> 做 中国 菜。<span class="pinyin">Māma <em>bù huì</em> zuò Zhōngguó cài.</span><span class="trans">Mom can't cook Chinese food.</span>
* 你 <em>不会</em>  游泳 吗？<span class="pinyin"> Nǐ <em>bù huì</em> yóuyǒng ma?</span><span class="trans">You can't swim?</span>
* 我 奶奶 <em>不会</em> 用 电脑。<span class="pinyin">Wǒ nǎinai <em>bù huì</em> yòng diànnǎo.</span><span class="trans">My grandmother can't use a computer.</span>
* 你 <em>不会</em> 开车 吗？<span class="pinyin">Nǐ <em>bù huì</em>  kāichē ma?</span><span class="trans">You can't drive a car?</span>

</div>

Note that if we say 我不能说中文 (wǒ bù néng shuō Zhōngwén), the speaker is saying that he can't speak Chinese [[Expressing ability or possibility with "neng"|for some reason other than his own ability]], perhaps because speaking Chinese in English class is forbidden.
